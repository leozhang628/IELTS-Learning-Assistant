Who is this book aimed at? 

Tli is book is designed for candidates of any level hoping 10 lake the 
IEIJS test. II is suitable for students working alone or in a classroom 
situation. The ti 1 aitrials can be used for sell-study, or can be imcgraied 
imo an IEI.TS preparation course. The book is also a valuable resource 
for teachers who are preparing IELTS candidates. 


How can students of different fevels use 
this book? 


The IELTS test lias two modules: the Academic Module ami the General 
Training Module (see the following pages for an explanation of the 
two). Each Academic Module candidate will take the same test, no 
matter what his or her English level is. Similarly, each General Training 
candidate will take the same General Training test. So, the information 
in this hook is useful and important to students of every level, 

Lower-level language students generally need more guided practice and 
there are exercises in this book to provide this. However, they also need 
experience and practice in expressing themselves more freely, as this is 
what IEI.TS requires them to do. Similarly, more advanced students need 
frequent opportunities for self-expression, but they also need to become 
more self-critical and aware of their own common mistakes. Corpus 
research has shown that even high-level candidates make careless slips, 
so all levels can benefit from both controlled and iree practice. 


What are the aims of this book? 


This book aims to provide an official, comprehensive guide to IELTS as 
well as a range of authentic practice tests. 

The skills section of the book provides 

* a detailed explanation of each paper and each section of IELTS; 

* examples of the different types of question candidates can expect to 
find in each section; 

• an analysts of the language skills and strategies needed for each type 
of question; 

• study tips and lest dps that can help you to achieve your best score. 


This book also contains eight complete Practice Tests, to give you 
thorough preparation. 










Introduction 


How is the book organised? 

At (he beginning of the book, there is a summary of each 1E LTS paper. Then, 
there are four sections dealing with the four skills covered in 1ELTS: Listening, 
Reading, Writing and Speaking. These are divided into units, which focus on 
key areas aiming to build your abilities and confidence, and provide authentic 
test practice. The second half of the book contains eight complete Practice Tests, 
each with a comprehensive answer key. The lirst practice test contains hints 
and reminders to guide you. At the end of the book, you will lind the Answer 
Key and complete Recording Scripts. 

How do I use this book? 

For the skills sections, it is liest to work through each unit in order. This is 
because [lie tasks and information are graded, developing your skills as the 
units progress. However, the different skills can be covered in any order. For 
example, you may decide to concentrate on only one skill at a time, or you 
may want to work on all lour skills to provide a more balanced course. You 
should study alt of the skills units before taking the Practice Tests. 

When taking the Practice Tests, try to use the tips and strategies 
recommended in the skills units. You should also try to take the tests under 
exam conditions and stick closely to the time limits in the test. 

How is this book different from other books? 

This book is the only official guide to HILTS. The skills units and Practice 
Tests have been written by IEI,TS exam writers, so you can be sure they 
contain authentic, accurate and up-to-date information and advice. For the 
first time, we have also included a DVD showing I BITS Speaking tests, along 
with a commentary to explain the candidates’ scores. Gur writers have used 
the Cambridge Learner Corpus to help choose the most appropriate language 
and skill areas to focus on. 

What is the Cambridge Learner Corpus? 

co The Cambridge Learner Corpus is the world's largest learner corpus. It 
is made up of thousands of exam scripts written by students from all over 
ihe world who have taken Cambridge ESOL exams. The corpus allows us to 
sec the types of error candidates commonly make in the 1ELTS exam at each 
different level 

What is 'paraphrase' and why is it important? 

Paraphrase is the use of different words to express the same idea. In order 
to lest whether you have understood the Reading and Listening texts, 
the questions in IELTS will paraphrase the words used in the texts. In the 
Writing and Speaking sections of the test, being able to use paraphrase, 
instead of simply repeating and copying the words in the question, will show 
that you have a wide vocabulary and help you to achieve a higher score. So, 
using and understanding paraphrase is important in every part of the lest.

Test Tip The questions 
in the Listening paper 
are in the same order 
as the information 
you hear This means 
that you will hear 
the information you 
need for Question 
1 before you hear 
the information for 
Question 2, etc. 
However, in questions 
where you have to 
choose an option from 
a fist, (e.g. multiple 
choice or matching 
items) the list of 
possible options wilf be 
in random order. 



Test Tip Make 
sure that you pay 
dose attention to 
any negatives in the 
options, as well as 
any adjectives. With 
matching or multiple 
choice tasks, pay 
careful attention to the 
question, as well as the 
options. The question 
will tell you how many 
answers you have to 
choose, as welt as 
what you need to listen 
for (e.g. problems, 
solutions, advantages, 
etc.).

Health-Tea 


Ski Cowans looks at the health properties of a favourite drink 

If you are a tea drinker you have probably heard of tannins, which are plant based chemicals 
round in tea. They are responsible fur the astringent bitter taste sometimes associated with tea. 
When you drink a snip of tea. it usually dissolves and remains dear unless the water is too cold or 

too alkaline. 


Tannins occur in many different types of plants and food, but 
are especially present in oak galls, which have been used 
for centuries in Chinese medicine due to their health giving 
properties. Tannins are often present in drinks and medicine 
because they are soluble in water, but how much they dissolve 
depends on factors like temperature and the chemical make up 
of the liquid.

2 Skimming a passage and speed reading 

Skimming a passage means reading it quickly (concentrating on 
eon lent words, like nouns and verbs) to find the main points. Ie is 
not reading for detail. Skimming a text will also give you a general 
idea of how the information is organised, which can help you locate 
information more easily later on, In your own language, you can 
probably skim read 100 words in 20 seconds. In the exam, you should 
aim lo skim read 100 words in 30 seconds. 

2,1 This passage has four paragraphs of around 100 words each* 

1 Using a timer, skim read Lite text to get the general idea of 
what it is about. 

2 After 30 seconds, jump to the start of the next paragraph. 


A The diets of children have changed dramatically over the Past century 
due to the effect of technologies (such as improved transport, canning 
and refrigeration), social changes (such as the establishment of boarding 
schools) and evolving ideas about the nutritional needs of growing bodies. 
Before World War I, the meaEs of children and adults alike would typically 
consist of vegetables (often potatoes), large amounts of bread (often 
0.5 kg/day) and soups with small amounts of meat. 

B I magine a 12-year-old Australian boy from 1970 standing next to a 12-year- 
old boy from 2010. The boy from 2010 will probably be 3-5 cm taller and 7 
kg heavier than his counterpart in 1970,. He will al$o be 25% fatter A lot of 
that fat will be around the waist The 2010 school trousers won't fit the boy 
from 1970: they will be 10 cm too big around the waist. Now imagine that 
the two boys have a running race of over 1,600 metres: the boy from 1970 
will finish 300 metres ahead of his mate from 40 years in the future. 

C There are two chances in three that the boy from 1970 walked to school 
each day; there are three chances in four that the boy from 2010 is driven 
to school by mum or dad. There are four chances in five that in 1970 the 
boy was allowed to play unsupervised in the neighbourhood; there is only 
one chance in four that in 2010 the boy will be allowed to go down to the 
park on his own, The boy in 1970 probably played three or four different 
sports; the boy from 2010 plays one or none. It is 30 times more likely that 
the local river was the favourite play space of the boy from 1970 than it is 
for the boy today. 

D What has caused these dramatic changes in the space of a single 

generation? There are two main theories. Increasing overweight is caused 
by an energy imbalance; either energy intake (food) increases, or energy 
expenditure decreases, or both. The 'Gluttony Theory” argues that children 
are fatter because they are eating more than they used to r and more bad 
food (high energy density, high in fat and sugar, high in saturated fats}. The 
"Sloth Theory" argues that children are fatter because they are less active 
than they used to be. The two theories have battled it out in nutrition and 
physical activity journals for the last 10 years.

C near the end. 

1 a comparison of children now and in the past 

2 different hypotheses for the changes in weight

2.3 Questions 1-3 in 2.2 each give the main idea of the paragraphs 
in the passage. Read the questions again and decide which 
paragraph (A-D) they relate to. 

3 Global understanding 

Sometimes, you may be asked a question that focuses on the whole 
Reading passage* This type of question may ask you to choose a 
suitable title for the passage. 


3.1 Which title (A-D) would be the most suitable for the Reading 
passage in 2.1? 

A Children's eating patterns mimic those of their parents 
£5 The rapid transformation occurring in children's body size 
C A demonstrated positive link between diet and health in 
children 

D The impact of modern technology on today's food production 

Skim reading a passage can also give you a sense of the attitude of the 
writer. Global questions can sometimes focus on this, 

3.2 Read the passage again and answer the global question below. 
Which of the following describes the writer's lone in this passage? 

A He is giving a neutral account of recent scientific research. 

B He is shocked that so many children are becoming overweight. 
C 1 le feels enthusiastic about the progress that is being made, 

D He is doubtful that the situation will change in the near future. 








2 Descriptive passages 

In this unit you wilt practise: 

* scanning for specific details * competing notes or a flow-chart 

• recognising paraphrase ■ labelling a diagram 


1 Scanning for detail 

The passages in the IELTS Reading paper gradually become more 
difficult, with Section i being the easiest 

1.1 Spend one minute skim reading the following passage to get 
a sense of the overall meaning. What is the main topic? 

A new discoveries in chemistry 
B the discove ry i if a n cien 1< >(>[ ect s 
C how into national scientific teams work 


Ochre find reveals ancient knowledge of chemistry 

Ihe oldest ochre-processing toolkits and workshop ever found have keen unearthed, indicating that as far hack as 
100,000 years ago, humam had an understanding of chemistry. 

South Africa's Blombus Cave lies within a limestone cliff cm the southern Cape coast, 300 km east of Cape 
Town. Its known for its 75*000-year-old rich deposits of artefacts such as beads, bone tools and ochre 
engravings. Some engravings date as far back as 100*000 years. 

Archaeologist Christopher S, Henshihvood from the University ot" Wit waters rand hi Johannesburg and University 
of Bergen* Norway has been excavating at the site since 1992* and has reported the discovery of a mixture, rich in 
ochre, stored in two ahakme shells. It dales back to the Middle Stone Age - 100*000 years ago. Ochre is a term used 
to describe a piece of earth or rock containing red or yellow oxides or hydroxides of iron. It can be used to make 
pigments, or paints, ranging from golden-yellow and light yellow-brown to a rich red. Its use spans the history of 
humans - from those living more than 200*000 years ago, to modern indigenous communities. 

Made from an array of materials* this mixture, which could have functioned as wall, object and skin 
decoration or skin protection (acting in a similar way to modern-day sunscreen), indicates the early 
developments that occurred in the people who origi nally used the site. 

"[fudging from] the complexity of the material that has been collected from different parts of the landscape 
and brought to the site, they | the people] must have had an elementary knowledge of chemistry to be able to 
combine these materials to produce ibis form. Its not a straightforward process,™ said Henshilwood.

2 Using words from the passage 

Their are several types of question that ask you to write a word and/or 
number from the passage. 

* You will be told the maximum number of words to write. 

* You must only write words that are in the passage. Make sure you 
copy the spelling correctly, 

1 ^ ^ need to change the words in the passage and you do not 
need to join words together. 

II um w rite tuo many words or make a spelling mistake, your answer 
wilt he marked wrong. 

Test Tip if the question asks you to write TWO WORDS AND/OR A 
NUMBER, this means the answer may be: 

* one word 

* one word + a number 
■ two words 

* two words + a number 

Remember that even if a number is written as a word, it counts as a 
number (e.g. twenty five trees = one word and a number). You do not 
need to write full sentences or join words together, For example: 

Answer the question with NO MORE THAN TWO WORDS from 
the reading passage.

5 Nowadays, who makes use of ochre? 

6 Apart from painting, what else might ancient humans have used ochre for? 


3 Notes/flow-chart/diagram completion 

The questions in 3.] all focus on paraphrase. Paraphrase is the use of 
different words with the same meaning. This helps to test how much 
of the Reading passage you understand. 

3.1 Look again at Questions 4-6. 

1 For Question 4, which word/s in the passage mean the same as 
'keep ... in'?

passage to get the general meaning. 


The Blombos Cave discovery is the ear I lest’known example of a pigment- or paint-producing workshop. 

All of the materials were discovered at the same site, and they included an array of raw materials including 
samples of bone and charcoal, as welt as pigment-producing equipment such as grindstones and 
ha miners tones, Judging by the equipment, which shows signs of wear, Henshilwood and his team were 
able to deduce the process used to produce the ochre mixture, 

First, the pieces of ochre were rubbed on quartzite slabs and crushed to produce a red powder, This was combined 
with ground-up mammal bone, the traces of which show signs that it was heated before being ground.The ochre 
powder and the bone pieces were mixed with charcoal, stone chips, quartz grains and a liquid (perhaps water) 
and was then transferred to abalone shells to be gently stirred before being ready for application.

The power of water 

Most hydropower plants rely on a dam that holds back water, creating a large reservoir 
behind it. Often, this reservoir is used as a recreational lake and is also known as the 
intake. Gates on the dam open and gravity pulls the water through the penstock, a line of 
pipe that leads to the turbine. Water builds up pressure as it flows through this pipe. The 
water strikes and turns the large blades of a turbine, which is attached to a generator 
above it by way of a shaft. As the turbine blades turn, so do a series of magnets inside 
the generator producing alternating current [AC] by moving electrons. The transformer, 
located inside the powerhouse, takes the AC and converts it to higher-voltage current. 


3.12 Answer Questions 1-5 on the diagram. 

3.13 Replace the underlined words below with appropriate 
paraphrases from the text, 

1 The dam helps con lain the water and produces a reservoir. 

2 The water moves through a pipe and increases in pressure. 

} The water rotates the blades of a turbine that is connected to a 
generator.

3 Understanding the main ideas 

In this unit you will practise; 

* distinguishing main ideas from supporting ideas 

* understanding the main points 

* identifying information in a Reading passage 
- matching headings 

* multiple choice 

■ True / False / Not Given 


1 Identifying the main idea 

In Lhc IELTS Reading paper, you may be asked to match, a list of 
headings with the correct paragraph or section of a passage. Tito 
headings summarise the main idea of the paragraph or section. 

The passage may be divided into paragraphs or sections (i.e. with 
more than one paragraph in a section}. Matching headings questions 
arc always placed before the passage on the question paper. 

1.1 Read headings i-vii. What topic do all of the headings have in 
common? Underline lhc main points in each heading. 


List of headings 

i The future of urban planning in America 

ii Conflicting ideas through the history of urban planning 

iii Urban planning has a long and vaned history 

iv Financial problems helped spread an urban planning concept 

v The background to one particular planned community 

vi Political change obstructs progress tn urban planning 

vii An urban plan to reduce traffic 



Test Tip Use this 

approach when 

matching headings, 

1 Read the headings so 
that you are familiar 
with them. 

2 Skim read the whole

Planned communities: garden cities 
A 

The notion of planning entire communities prior to their construction is an ancient one. In fact, one of the earliest 
such cities on record is Miletus, Greece, which was built in the 4th century BC- Throughout the Middle Ages and 
the Renaissance, various planned communities (both theoretical and actual) were conceived. Leonardo da Vinci 
designed several cities that were never constructed. Following the Great Fire of London in 1666, the architect 
Christopher Wren created a new master plan for the city, incorporating park land and urban space. Several 18th- 
century cities, including Washington D.C., New York City, and St Petersburg, Russia, were built according to 
comprehensive planning, 

8 

One of the most important planned city concepts, the Garden City Movement, arose in the latter part of the 
19th century as a reaction to the pollution and crowding of the industrial Revolution. In 1890, Ebenezer Howard 
published the book To-Morrow: A Peaceful Path to Reaf Reform in which he laid out his ideas concerning the 
creation of new economically viable towns. Howard believed that these towns should be limited in site and 
density, and surrounded with a belt of undeveloped land, The idea gained enough attention and financial backing 
to lead to the creation of Letchwodh, in Hertfordshire, England, Unis was the first such 'Garden City'. After the 
First World War, the second town built following Howard's ideas, Welwyn Garden City, was constructed, 

C 

In the early 1920s, American architects Clarence Stein and Henry Wright, inspired by Howard's ideas and 
the success of Letchworth and Welwyn, created the city of Radburn, New Jersey, Conceived as a community 
which would be safe for children, Radburn was intentionally designed so that the residents would not require 
automobiles. Several urban planning designs were pioneered at Radburn that would Influence later planned 
communities, including the separation of pedestrians and vehicles, and the use of 'superblocks', each of which 
shared 23 acres of commonly held parkiand. 

D 

In America, following the stock market crash of 1929, there was great demand for both affordable housing and 
employment for workers who had lost their jobs. In direct response to this, in 1935 President Roosevelt created the 
Resettlement Administration, which brought about a total of three greenbelt towns: Greenbelt, Maryland; Greenhills, 
Ohio; and Greendale, Wisconsin. These towns contained many of the elements of the Garden City Movement 
developments, including the use of superb locks and a 'green belt' of undeveloped land surrounding the community. 


1,3 Read Paragraph A and choose the best summary: 

A Past. present and future examples of urban planning 
B The history' of urban planning 
C Problems associated with urban planning 


1.4 Create a shortlist of possible answers for Paragraph A. 

1 Decide which headings (i-vii) you can confidently say are not 
connected to the main topic of paragraph A. 

2 Look ai your shortlist again and choose the heading that best 
summarises the main idea of all of paragraph A. 


1.5 Read Paragraphs B-D again, and repeat the steps above. 

1.6 Look again at headings i-vii. For headings i. ii and vi, explain 
why they don't match any paragraphs. 


I Test Tip Don't try to 
match words in the 
headings to words in the 
passage. You need to 
focus on the whole idea 
of each paragraph.

2 Understanding the main points 

Another type of question that can fbtus on the main point of a 
paragraph is multiple choice. This type of question often requires 
you to carefully read more ilian one sentence in the paragraph, 

2*1 Look at this question, based on the passage in 1.2. 

I In Paragraph A, what is the main point that the writer makes? 

A Some urban designs are better in theory than in practice. 

8 The urban-planning concept itself is not restricted to 
modern times. 

C Urban planning should be carried out by professionals. 
r> Some planned ancient cities are more successful than 
modern ones.

3 Identifying information in a passage 

For True / False / Not Given tasks, you need 10 look at a list of 
sun tenets or statements and decide whether they are: 

* True (the statement agrees with the inform at i oti in the text) 

* False (the statement is incorrect and does not agree with the 
information in the text) 

* Not Given (you cannot say whether the statement is true or false 

because there is no information about this in the text) 

3.1 Skim read this passage to get the general idea of the content. 



Test Tip Remember 
that you are being 
tested on your ability 
to understand the 
information you read 
in the passage So you 
should ignore anything 
you already know about 
the topic. 


Urban heat 

In ISIS, Luke Howard published The Climate of London 
in which he identified an emerging problem: urban 
development was having a direct impact on the local 
weather. The early 1800s was a time of great expansion 
for London and 1 Howard noticed that temperatures in 
the city were gradually becoming higher than those in 

rural areas. We now refer to these areas as UrbanJdeat 

Islands . J The difference in temper ature is usua lly greater 
at night and the phenomenon occurs in both winter 

an^surnmec 1 Experts agree that this is due to urban 
development, when o pen green sp aces are replaced 

with asphalt roads and tall bric k or concrete buildings. 
These materials retain heat generated bv the Sun and 

release it through the ni ght. In Atlanta, in the US, this 
has even led to thunderstorms occurring in the morning 
rather than, as is mo re common, in the afternoon. 
Officials there are advising builders to use light-coloured 
roofs in a bid to reduce the problem. 


Large cities around the world are adopting strategies 
to combat this issue and it is not uncommon to find 
plants growing on top of roofs or down the walls of 
large buildings. In Singapore, the government has 
pledged to transform It into a 'city within a garden’ 
and, in 2006, they held an international competition 
calling for entries to develop a master plan to help 
bring this about. One outcome was the creation of 18 
'Supertrees! These metal constructions are made to 
resemble very tall trees and range in height from 25m 
to 50m. Each one is a vertical freestanding garden 
and is home to exotic plants and ferns. Their structure 
allowed the designers to create an immediate 
rainforest canopy without having to wait for trees to 
reach such heights. They contain solar panels used to 
light the trees at night and also containers to collect 
rainwater, making them truly self-sufficient. 


3.2 Decide if statements 1-3 are True, False or Nat Given according to the underlined 
parts of the text. 

1 Luke Howard invented the term 'Urban Heat Island'. 

2 City temperatures are higher than country temperatures regardless of the season. 

3 Experts have failed in their efforts to create heat-refleeting concrete and brick. 

3.3 Read statements 4-8, then underline ihc relevant parts in the text. Arc the 
statements True, False or Nci Given? 

4 Atiania has experienced more dramatic weather change than other areas of the US. 

5 Roofs that are dark in colour help address the issue of Urban Heat islands. 

6 Singapore's Supenrees are made entirely from natural materials. 

7 The designers of the Supertrees originally planned to plant very tall trees. 

8 The Superirees require regular maintenance. 


3.4 Read statements 1-8 again and correct any that were false.

Meerkats devote a significant part 
of their day to foraging for food with 
their sensitive noses. When they find 
it, they eat on the spot. Primarily, 
meerkats are insecLivores. which 
means their diet is mainly made up 
of insects.

How geckos cope with 

A Geckos are remarkable little lizards, dinging to almost 
any dry surface, and Alyssa Stark, from the University 
of Akron, US, explains that they appear to be equally 
happy scampering through tropical rainforest canopies 
as they are in urban settings. A lot of gecko studies 
look at the very small adhesive structures on their 
toes to understand how the system works at the most 
basic level; says Stark. She adds that the animals grip 
surfaces with microscopic hairs on the soles of their 
feet which make dose enough contact to be attracted 
to the surface by the minute forces between atoms. 

B However, she and her colleagues Timothy Sullivan 
and Peter Niewiarowski were curious about how 
the lizards cope on surfaces in their natural habitat. 
Explaining that previous studies had focused on 
the reptiles dinging to artificial dry surfaces. Stark 
says 'We know they are in tropical environments 
that probably have a lot of rain and geckos don't 
suddenly fall out of the trees when it's wetl Yet the 
animals do seem to have trouble getting a grip on 
smooth, wet artificial surfaces, sliding down wet 
vertical glass after several steps. The team decided 
to find out how geckos with wet feet cope on both 
wet and dry surfaces. 

C First, they had to find out how well their geckos 
dung onto glass with dry feet Fitting a tiny harness 
around the lizard's pelvis and gently lowering 
the animal onto a plate of smooth glass. Stark 
and Sullivan allowed the animal to become well 
attached before connecting the harness to a tiny 
motor and gently pulling the lizard until it came 
unstuck- The geckos hung on tenaciously, and only 
came unstuck at forces of around 20N - about 20 
times their own body weight’ln my view, the gecko 
attachment system is over-designed,'says Stark. 



D Next, the trio sprayed the glass plate with a mist of 
water and re-tested the lizards, but this time the 
animals had problems holding tight. The droplets 
were interfering with the lizards'attachment 
mechanism, but it wasn't clear how. And when 
the team immersed the geckos in a bath of room- 
temperature water with a smooth glass bottom, 
the animals were completely unable to anchor 
themselves to the smooth surface. The toes are 
super-hydrophobic,'(i.e. water repellent) explains 
Stark, who could see a silvery bubble of air around 
their toes. But, they were unable to displace the 
water around their feet to make the tight contact 
that usually keeps the geckos in place. 

E Then the team tested the lizard's adhesive forces on 
the dry surface when their feet had been soaking 
for 90 minutes, and found that the lizards could 
barely hold on, detaching when they were pulled 
with a force roughly equalling their own weight. 
That might be the sliding behaviour that we see 
when the geckos climb vertically up misted glass', 
says Stark. So, geckos climbing on wet surfaces with 
damp feet are constantly on the verge of slipping 
and Stark adds that when the soggy lizards were 
faced with the misted and immersed horizontal 
surfaces, they slipped as soon as the rig started 
pulling. Therefore geckos can walk on wet surfaces, 
as long as their feet are reasonably dry. However, 
as soon as their feet get wet, they are barely able to 
hang on, and the team is keen to understand how 
long it takes geckos to recover from a drenching.

Aesop’s fable The crow and the pitcher’ more fact than fiction 

New resear ch indicates that rooks, members of the crow family, are able 
to solve complex problems using tools. 


In Aesop's fictional fable The crow and the 
pitcher', a thirsty crow uses stones to rarse 
the level of water in a jug to quench its 
thirst. A recent study demonstrates that 
rooks, birds belonging to the corvid [or crow) 
family, are in fact able to solve complex 
problems using tools and can easily master 
the same technique used in the story, 

Christopher Bird of the University of 
Cambridge, who led the study, highlighted the 
importance of the findings, stating: 'Corvids 
are remarkably intelligent, and in many 
ways rival the great apes in their physical 
intelligence and ability to solve problems. The 
only other animal known to complete a similar 
task is the oreng-utan. This is remarkable 
considering their brain is so different to the 
great apes. Although it has been speculated 
in folklore, empirical tests are needed to 
examine the extent of their intelligence and 
how they solve problems,' 

In their first experiment, the researchers 
varied the height of the water in a tube 
and the four rooks, which were the subject 
of the research, used stones to raise the 
water level to reach a worm floating on 
top. The clever birds proved very adept and 
were highly successful, regardless of the 
starting level of the water or the number of 
the stones needed. Two of the birds were 
successful on their first attempt in raising 
the water to the correct height whilst the 
other two birds needed a second try. 

In addition to the speed with which they 
completed the task, the birds were also 
highly accurate in their ability, adding the 
exact number of stones needed to reach the 
worm, Furthermore, rather than attempting 
to reach the worm after each stone was 
dropped in, they apparently estimated the 
number needed from the outset, and waited 
until the appropriate water level was reached 
before dipping their beaks into the tube. 



In the second experiment, the rooks wars 
presented with stones that varied in size. 
Here, the rooks selected larger stones over 
smaller ones (though they didn't do this 
straight away]. The scientists speculate that 
the birds quickly realised that the larger 
stones displaced more water, and they were 
thus able to obtain the reward more quickly 
than by using small stones. 

According to the team, in the final 
experiment, the rooks recognised that 
sawdust could not be manipulated in the 
same manner as water, Therefore, when 
presented with the choice between a tube 
half-filled with either sawdust or water, rooks 
dropped the pebbles into the tube containing 
water and not the sawdust. 

Despite the fact that Che study clearly 
demonstrates the flexible nature of tool use 
in rooks, they are not believed to use tools 
rn the wild. ‘Wild tool use appears to be 
dependent on motivation,' remarked Bird. 
Rooks do not use tool© in the wild because 
they do not need to, not because they can’t. 
They have access to other food that can 
be acquired without using tools.' As Bird 
noted, that fits nicely with Aesop's maxim, 
demonstrated by the crow: 'Necessity is the 
mother of invention,'

Maths shows why words persist over time 

In a finding that parallels the evolution of genes, researchers have shown that the 
more frequently a word is used, the less likely it is to change over long periods of 
time. 

The question of why some words evolve rapidly through time while others are preserved - often 
with the same meaning in multiple languages - has long plagued linguists. Two independent 
teams of researchers have tackled this question from different angles, each arriving at a 
remarkably similar conclusion. 

'The frequency with which specific words are used in everyday language exerts a general and 
law-Uke influence on their rates of evolution," writes Mark Pagel, author of one of two studies 
published this week. 

Anyone who has tried to learn English will have been struck by its excess of stubbornly 
irregular verbs, which render grammatical rules unreliable. The past tense of regular verbs is 
formed by adding the suffix -ed', but this luxury is not afforded to their irregular kin. Over 
time, however, some irregular verbs ‘regularise', For instance, the past tense of ‘help' used to be 
'help', but now it is ‘helped', 

Mathematician Erez Lieberman, from Harvard University in Massachusetts, US, performed a 
quantitative study of the rate at which English verbs such as 'help' have become more regular 
with time. Of the list of 1 71 irregular verbs they took from Old English, only 9S are still irregular 
today. Amazingly, the changes they observed obey a very precise mathematical description: the 
half-life of an irregular verb is proportional to the square root of its frequency, hi other words, 
they found that the more an irregular verb is used, the longer it will remain irregular, 

A separate group of academics, led by evolutionary biologist Mark Pagel from the University of 
Reading, in the UK, used a statistical modelling technique to study the evolution of words from 
8? different Indo-European languages. 

■‘Throughout its 8,000-year history, all Indo-European-language speakers have used a related 
sound to communicate the idea of ‘two’ objects - duo, due, deux, dos, etc." Pagel commented, 
“But," he adds, “there are many different and unrelated sounds for the idea of, for example, a 
bird - uccello, oiseau, pouli, pajaro, vogel, etc." 

Before now, however, nobody had proposed a mechanism for why some words should evolve 
more quickly than others. According to Pagel, “our research helps us to understand why we can 
still understand bits of Chaucer [a medieval poetj" and points out that this likely explains “why 
we can instinctively recognise words in other Indo-European languages, just from their sounds" 

Psychologist and language expert Russell Cray, from the University of Auckland in New 
Zealand, was impressed by both findings. 

'Despite all the vagaries and contingencies of human history, it seems that there are remarkable 
regularities in the processes of language change," he commented.

6 Multiple-choice questions 

In this unit you will practise: 

• understanding longer pieces of text 

• different types of multiple-choke questions 
■ answering multiple-choice questions 

• identifying a writer's purpose 


1 Understanding longer pieces of text 

To answer multiple choice questions, you often need to carefully 
read iwo or more connected sentences or several connected sentences. 

1.1 Look at this extract from an IELT5 Reading passage. Read it 
quickly to find out the main points and then re-read it more 
carefully (o ga a more detailed understanding. 


Linguists agree that language is needed during reading, but at which 
stage language becomes a necessity has come under debate. Past research 
has shown that animals have the ability to discriminate letters from one 
another, but previously, experts thought the ability to recognise written 
words was dependent on an ability to understand language. Findings 
recently published n the journal Science challenge this long-held notion, 
showing that despite having no linguistic skills* monkeys are able to tell 
the difference between sequences of letters that form real English words* 
and those that do not. 


1.2 Without looking back at ihe extract, try to explain whal it is 
about, in your own words. 

Some multiple-choice questions begin with a direct question and then 
have four possible answers. Some begin with an incomplete sentence 
and then have four possible endings, 

1.3 Look at the question below and choose the best answer, A-D. 

1 According to the paragraph, what point do linguists have 
different views on?

2 Different types of multiple choice 

Sometimes you may be asked lo choose two correct answers from five 
options. You will need to read and consider even more text. 

2.1 Spend 45 seconds skim reading this Reading passage lo find out 
the main points. 


What do hurricanes mean for dolphins? 

Hurricanes are typically associated with loss of life, loss of property and economic devastation. 
Hurricane Katrina, which blew through the gulf coast of North America in 2005, brought all 
those things and more. It also brought lots of baby dolphins. Hurricanes tend to be related to 
increased standings of marine mammals, so why might a hurricane be associated with more 
dolphins, rather than fewer? 

Scientist Lance J. Miller reasoned that there were probably several related phenomena that, 
combined, could explain the apparent increase. Firstly, after a female dolphin loses her calf, 
she can give birth again much sooner than if her calf had matured to adulthood. "If a large 
number of calves perished as a result of Hurricane Katrina, this would allow for a greater 
percentage of females to become reproductive!) active the following year," Bv itself, this didn't 
seem to adequately explain the increase in dolphin calves. Something else was going on. That 
something was distinctively human. 

When I lurricane Katrina blew through the gulf, the local shrimping, crabbing and fishing 
industries were ravaged. In Mississippi, according to one estimate, 87% of commercial fishing 
vessels were damaged or destroyed. This meant a decrease in the amount of seafood brought 
into shore, of nearly 15%. Despite the common notion that dolphins enjoy playing in the wakes 
created by boats, there is plenty of evidence that dolphins actually avoid them. Miller deduced 
that, with a reduction in the number of boats in the water, both commercial and recreational, 
dolphins may have been able to spend more time eating, and less time travelling or diving in 
an effort to avoid boats. 


2.2 Look at tliis task. What informal ion do you need to find in the 
passage? 

Which TWO possible issues did Miller believe may have caused the rise in dolphin numbers? 

A More female dolphins survived the hurricane than males. 

B Female dolphins were able to breed earlier than usual, 

C The dolphins had access to greater numbers of shrimp and fish, 

D There was a decrease in the number of dolphins being caught for sport or food. 

E The dolphins had less contact with humans after the hurricane, 


2.3 Read the passage again and highlight the parts that introduce 
(he idea of a first and second issue. Read the options A-E in 2.2 
carefully and decide which two options are correct.

3 identifying a writer's purpose 

Sometimes, multiple-choice questions ask you to consider t he writer's 
purpose or aim. You may be asked to identify: 

* why the writer made a particular reference 

* wlvat the purpose of a part of the text is 

* the opinion or attitude of the writer. 

3.1 Look at this extract from a Reading passage to gel the main idea and 
then re-read it more carefully to understand it in detail. 


One of the reasons Jurassic Pttri was so successful - as a novel and a blockbuster Him - is 
that it presented a plausible way co bring dinosaurs back to life. The idea that viable dinosaur 
DNA might be retrieved from bloodsucking prehistoric insects seemed like a projeer that 
could actually succeed. Even though the actual methodology is hopelessly flawed and would 
never work, the premise was sciencc-ish enough to let us suspend our disbelief and revel in 
tile return of the dinosaurs. 


3.2 Read these questions .inti consider how you would answer them, 

1 What is the writer's purpose in this paragraph? 

2 What is the writer’s opinion ol Jurassic Park? 

To answer these questions, you need to consider more than the surface 
meaning of the words in the Reading passage. You need to consider the 
writer's tone or attitude, 

3.3 Scan the extract in 3.1 and find the following words or phrases: 
blockbuster, hopelessly flawed, revel in. Do they suggest a positive or a 
negative tone? 

3.4 Answer the questions by choosing the correct letter (A, B, C or D). 

1 What is the writer's purpose in this paragraph? 

A to suggest that scientists should look to science fiction for 
inspiration 

ti to argue that people may choose to believe the improbable in 
order to be entertained 

C its persuade us that an and science can be skilfully linked 
D to demonstrate that scientific research can provide a source of 
entertainment

Living with Mies 

Lafayette Park is a group of modernist townhouses in the US designed by the architect Mies van 
der Rohe. 

A few blocks east of downtown Detroit sits Lafayette Park, an enclave of single- and two-storey 
modernist town houses set amid a forest of locust trees. Like hundreds of developments nationwide, 
they were the result of postwar urban renewal: unlike almost all of them, it had a trio of world-class 
designers behind it: Ludwig Hilbersheimer as urban planner; Alfred Caldwell as landscape designer: 
and Mies van der Rohe as architect. 

The townhouses were built between 1958 and 1962 on land previously occupied hy a working-class 
neighbourhood. While much of Detroit began a steep decline soon after. Lafayette Park stayed afloat, 
its residents bucking the trend of suburban flight, Lafayette Park today is one of the most racially 
integrated neighbourhoods in the city. It is economically stable, despite the fact that Detroit has 
suffered enormous poptdation loss, 

We wanted to know what residents think about this unique modernist environment created by a 
famous architect, and how they confront and adapt it to meet their needs. During our research, we 
were struck by the casual attitude that many residents have toward the architecture. Then again, 
Detroit has an abundance of beautiful housing options: one can live in a huge Victorian mansion, a 
beautiful arts and crafts house or a cavernous loft-conversion space in a former factory. Living in a 
townhouse built by a renowned architect isn't as noteworthy as one might think. At the same time, 
such nonchalance is a mark of success: the homes are great because they work, not because they 
come affixed with a famous name. 

Indeed, their beauty isn't always obvious. There is a kind of austere uniformity to the Lafayette Park 
townhouses when viewed from the outside. Some visitors find them unappealing: one contractor 
described them as ‘bunkers'. The interior layouts are nearly identical. The units are compact in size 
and some people find them too small, though the floor-to-ceiling windows on the front and back of 
each building open the living spaces to the outside. 

While they may have strong aesthetic preferences, the residents we spoke with do not necessarily 
favour mid-century modernism in their interiors or architecture. But they make it work: several 
people remarked on the way the interiors in the Lafayette Park townhouses can function as blank 
canvases for a variety of decorating styles. Indeed, the best design doesn't force a personality on its 
residents. Instead, it helps them bring out their own.

Meerkat study 


Dr Alex Thornton from the University of Cambridge recently led a study into meerkat 
society. Meerkats are highly social mongooses that live in large social groups and take 
turns foraging for food and standing guard to look out for predators. Research has shown 
that the animals have their own traditions within their group. For example, while members 
of one meerkat troop will consistently rise very early, those of another will emerge from their 
burrows much later in the morning. 

In an attempt to assess whether meerkats simply copy these behavior patterns or are 
taught them, Thornton and his team travelled to the Kalahari Desert and set a series of 
tests for a group in the wild. One test involved putting a scorpion (the meerkats' favourite 
food) into a transparent container, The meerkats had to work out how to open the opaque 
lid of the container in order to reach the scorpion inside. The tests showed that the more 
subordinate juvenile members of meerkat troops are the most innovative when it comes to 
foraging - these low-ranking males were best at solving problems and obtaining the treat. 
However, Dr Thornton conceded that the meerkats didn't ever appear to work out that it 
was the opaque surface of the box that they should attack in preference to the transparent 
ones. So, this may simply be evidence of persistence rather than actual intelligence.

distinct customs. They also learned that young, mate meerkats were more 2... 

than other members of their social groups when it came to problem solving. The researchers

Test Tip Try to spend 
no more than 15-20 
minutes on Section 1, 
so that you have 
enough time for the 
more difficult texts and 
questions in Sections 2 
and 3. Remember you 
only have 60 minutes to 
complete 40 questions, 
and you need to 
transfer your answers 
onto a separate sheet in 
that time. Aim to spend 
less than 20 minutes 
on each section so you 
have time to check your 
answers at the end.

2 who is likely to read this? 


Recycling 

Recycling tips and hints 

* Use separate bins or bags for waste and recyclables in the kitchen - it makes recycling 
easy. 

* Remember to recycle items from other rooms in your house. Try placing a separate bin 
in the bathroom, laundry or study. 

* Your normal household waste is collected every week and should go in the bin with the 
black lid. Place all recyclable items in your bin with a yellow lid. This will be emptied 
every two weeks, Make sure you do not include plastic shopping bags in with your 
recyclables. 

* You can find out your collection day by contacting the council on 3403 8888. You can 
also get a free reusable bag and use it to collect recyclables around the house or take it 
shopping and cut down on plastic bags. 

* You do not need to remove staples or the plastic window from envelopes, as this is 
done in the recycling process. 

* Tree trimmings, grass clippings and flowers are not recyclable, even though paper is 
made from woodchip, These items should either be turned into compost or placed in 
your general waste bin. 

Why recycle? 

For every tonne of waste paper that gets recycled, 13 trees are saved. One job is created 

for every 500 tonnes of paper collected for recycling. Every year in Australia, we use 

about 3.5 million tonnes of paper and cardboard - enough to fill 160,000 semi trailers. 

Paper can be recycled six times before it needs new fibres added.

Reading skills 


There are several types of questions that ask you to write words and/or 
numbers from the Reading passage. For these questions: 

* you will be told the maximum number of words to write. 

* you must only write words that are in the text (make sure you 
copy (he spelling correctly). 

* you do not need to change the words in the text and you do 
not need to join the words together. 


Scanning for detail 

1.4 Scanning a text involves searching it quickly for specific 
information. The information may appear only once or several 
limes (e.g, the name of a hotel). Scan the passage in 1.3 to find 
seven different numbers. 

1.5 Answer these short-answer questions. Choose NO MORE THAN 
ONE WORD AND/OR A NUMBER from the passage for each answer. 

1 What will you help to protect if you recycle one tonne of waste? 

2 How many tonnes of paper products do Australians use each 
year? 

J What is the telephone number of the recycling centre? 

You might also be asked id complete sentences using words from the 
Reading passage. 

Recognising paraphrase 

There may be key words in each question that you can locate in the 
Reading passage. However, some parts of the question will paraphrase 
(use another word that has the same meaning) the words in the 
passage. This tests how much you understand. 


Test Tip When 
answering short-answer 
questions, you do 
not need to write full 
sentences or join words 
together. Look at this 
example. 

Answer (he question 

with NO MORE THAN 
TWO WORDS from 
the reading passage. 

What TWO colours 
did the painter use? 

Answer: black white 
(not black and white) 


1.6 Complete the following sentences with NO MORE THAN TWO 
WORDS AND/OR A NUMBER from the passage. 

1 You should pul special bins for collecting recyclable* in different 

2 Plastic shopping hags should he put in the bin with the

Reading skills 


For identifying information tasks, you need to look at several 
sentences or statements and decide whether they are: 

True (the statement agrees with the information in the passage) 

False (the statement is incorrect and does not agree with the 
information in the passage) or 

Not Given (you cannot say whether the statement is true or false 
because there is no information about this in the passage) 

1.8 Look at the identifying information (ask below. 

Questions 1-5 

Do ihe following statements agree with the information given in the reading passage? 
in boxes 1-5 on your answer sheet, write 

TRUE if the statement agrees with the information 

FALSE if the statement contradicts the information 

NOT GIVEN if there is no information on this 

1 Envelopes with a plastic window are unsuitable for your recycling bin. 

2 Staples often damage the recycling machinery. 

3 Garden waste should be thrown away with food waste. 

4 Recycling can help to reduce unemployment. 

5 Paper that has already been recycled is unsuitable for recycling. 

6 The fibres that are added to recycled paper are environmentally friendly. 


Not given is not the same as False. 

In Question 1, unsuitable for your recycling bin means you cannot 
put it in the recycling bin'. 

The passage says You Jo not need to remove staples or the plastic 
window front envelopes as this is done in the recycling process. This 
means you can put envelopes with a plastic window in your 
recycling bin. So the statement in Ihe question is False. 

In Question 1, you need to find out from the passage if staples 
often damage the recycling machinery. The passage tells us that staples 
will be removed in the recycling process, but there is no information 
about staples causing damage to the machinery. We cart no l check 
this fact in ihe text, so this is Not Given. 

1.9 Decide if ihe statements in Questions 3-6 are True, False or Not 
Given. For each question, justify your answer using the relevant 
parts of ihe passage. 


Test Tip Remember 
that you are being 
tested on your ability 
to understand the 
information you read in 
the passage. So, you 
should ignore anything 
you already know about 
the topic.

2 Dealing with multiple texts 

In Section t of ihe General Training Reading paper, you may he given 
three or more short texts. The texts will all be based on a similar topic 
The questions will focus on what is different about the information in 
each text. You need to scan all of the lexis to locate the answers to the 
questions.

main points. Who do you think would read a text like this? 


A n person wanting io apply to become an inspector 
B the owner of a business 
C a new temporary employee at a company 
D an experienced inspector 


Workplace health and safety 


Workplace health and safety is the legal 
responsibility of all employers. There are rules 
and regulations governing workplace health 
and safety to help ensure the safety of workers 
in all industries. Workplace Health and Safety 
inspectors are employed by the government to 
carry out regular workplace inspections and 
ensure current safety standards are being met. 

Inspector training 

All inspectors complete a rigorous nine- 
month program of classroom training and field 
experience with a qualified inspector. New 
inspectors also receive training on Ihe regulations 
specific to their respective programs (i.e, 
construction, mining, healthcare, industrial and 
diving). Each inspector is issued a comprehensive 
manual of policies and procedures to be used 
when carrying out workplace inspections. 

Powers of an inspector 

Inspectors are employed to monitor employers 
and workers and ensure that they comply with 
the laws concerning Workplace Health and Safety. 
Inspectors' powers include the ability to enter any 
workplace without giving notice. 

Once an inspector has begun a workplace 
inspection, he or she is permitted to: 

• question any employee 

• handle, use or test any equipment, machinery 
and materials and take away any samples 

• look at any documents or records and take 
them from the workplace in order to make 
copies, and 

• take photographs. 

What to expect from a workplace health and 
safety visit 

Workplace visits by an inspector are typically 
unannounced and, by law an inspector must be 
granted access to enter and access all areas of 


the workplace. When a workplace health and 
safety inspector arrives at your workplace, he or 
she will introduce themselves and ask to speak 
with either the workplace health and safety 
representative or the most senior member of 
management available. If the staff concerned are 
not available, the inspector may continue with a 
limited inspection based on available information 
and/or arrange a follow-up visit later that day or 
on the following day. 

When all relevant staff have been assembled, 
the inspector will check that all of the required 
documentation is in place. This includes the 
employer's written occupational health and 
safety policy, and the health and safety- 
awareness poster. These must be displayed in 
an area accessible to ail employees. Any other 
documentation that shows workers have been 
provided with instructions on how to carry out 
specific tasks may also be requested. Finally, the 
inspector may ask to see where the documents 
are posted, and verify that a copy of the law and 
regulations is also displayed. 

Following the documentation review, the 
inspector will inspect the workplace to determine 
if staff are maintaining a safe work environment. 
Short videos describing the specific hazards that 
inspectors look for during an inspection can be 
obtained from the Department of Labour, 

If the inspector finds any fault within the 
workplace, then they may issue what is known as 
a compliance order. Compliance orders describe 
actions the employer is obliged to take in order 
to meet the current regulations. If the inspector 
believes there is immediate risk of injury to a 
worker, a 'stop work' order will be issued to prevent 
work from continuing until the problem is solved.

Banned Branding 

llm Sao Paulo's advertising experiment worked 7 


A When you think of Sao Paulo, Brazil, a city of 
12 million residents and the 7th largest in the world, 
you probably picture a gritty sprawling metropolis., 
with skyscrapers rising like islands in a sea of giant 
billboards and neon signs. But all of that changed 
in 2007 when Sao Paulo becajne the first major 
city in the world to ban all outdoor advertising. 

The 'Clean City Law' was the brainchild of Mayor 
Gilberto Kassab who, in a bid to combat all forms 
of pollution in the city, decided to begin by tackling 
the most obvious - the visual pollution' created by 
billboards and signs advertising brands of all kinds. 
The move was hailed by writer Roberto Fompeu 
de Toledo as '"a rare victory of the public interest 
over private'. 

B However, reactions LnSio Paulo were not all 
positive. Marketing executives were convinced 
thcil the new law would prove a terrible blow 
to the advertising industry and representatives 
drove i heir cars up and down in front of city hall 
to protest against the ruling. Border* the Brazilian 
Association of Advertisers, was incensed over the 
move, pointing out that tens of thousands of small 
businesses would have to bear the cost of altering 
their shop fronts under the new regulations. In 
the press, a US$133m loss in advertising revenue 
was forecast, while the Sao Paulo outdoor media 
association, Sepex r predicted job losses of up 
to 20,000. 

C Others were concerned with the aesthetic impact 
of I he move and that rather than cleaning up the 
city, it would look even worse. Would removing the 
colourful, though chaotic, billboards turn it into a 
bland concrete jungle? Dalton Silvano, the only city 
councillor to vote against the law, believed it would: 
'Advertising is both an arl form and, when you r n? 
in your ear or on foot, a form of entertainment that 
helps relieve solitude and boredom/ he claimed. 
Adding.. T think this city will become a Sadder, 
duller place.' 

D Nevertheless, the council pressed ahead with its 
plans. 'What we are aiming for is a complete change 
of culture,' Spokesman Roberto Tripoli said. Yes, 
some people art going to have to pay a price, but 
things were out of hand and the population has 
made it dear that it wants this/ Eventually, the 
law was passed and businesses were given 90 
days to take down any signs that did riot meet (he 
new regulations or pay a fine of up to $4,500 per 
day. Throughout that period, the city's workmen 
dismantled around 100Sites per day, occasionalLy 
supervised personally by Kassab, 


E 1 5,000 b i IIboards - some the size of the b lj il di ngs 
they adorned - huge outdoor video Screens,, and 
even posters and ads on the side of buses and 
la vis, were all quickly removed across the city- To 
help police, Kassab set up telephone hotlines sl> 
that citizens could report instances of advertisers 
breaking the law.'Some days we had 3,000 calls 
on those lines,' he said proudly. Even giving out 
pamphlets in public spaces was made illegal. 
Extraordinarily six years later, il is extremely 
difficult to find outdoor advertising anywhere in 
the city, 

F Equally remarkable is the speed with which big 
advertisers adapted to this new environment, 'it 
was really dramatic ... Big companies had to change 
their focus and strategies/ says Marcello Queiroz, 
editor of the newspaper ami Marketing. 

Marketing directors wx>n found new areas to spend 
their advertising budgets on. The move forced them 
to be more creative and find innovative methods 
of indoor advertising such as inside elevators and 
ba ih rooms. Other businesses were even more 
creative. Big banks and stores began painting 
their buildings in eye-catching colours, creating a 
visual pattern that consumers could associate their 
brand with, even from a distance. But, according to 
advertising executive Mardu Oliveira, The internet 
was the really big winner/ Although* at die time, 
there was already a worldwide move towards social 
media, the new law gave Brazilian ad agencies an 
extra Incentive. 

C For now then, the scheme has worked, and surveys 
conducted by local newspapers indicate it is 
extremely popular, with more than 7D% of residents 
showing their approval. II has also brought some 
unforeseen advantages. When the hoardings 
were removed, many locals were shocked at the 
state of the buildings and houses beneath. As a 
result, renovation work in the city has increased 
considerably and its cultural heritage is now more 
visible- As journalist Vincenze Galvao commented 
about finding his way around the city, 'My old 
reference was a big Panasonic billboard, but now 
my reference is an art deco building that had been 
covered by it- The city's now got new language, a 
new identity/

2 More complex charts 

The visual information you arc given in Writing Task l often asks you 
to compare or contrast different information. One way of allowing you 
to compare information is through a liar chart* 

2.1 Study the bar chart below. Notice that you have to estimate some 
ol the numbers. Answer the questions by choosing the best 
answer. A, B or C, 

One hundred adults, boys and girls in Manchester, England were 
asked to name the sports they participated in. The results were 
recorded in tlte following stacked bar chart.

Writing skills 


Usiiifi tilt 1 passive voice helps to show you are describing llie visual 
in formal ion, rather than giving your own ideas. To describe future 
predictions, we often use the passive form of the verbs estimate, predict, 
and forecast. These sentences often start with It. 


2,3 Rewrite these sentences, describing the graph in 2.2. 

1 i predict that sea levels will continue to rise.

Test Tip Each time you 
come across any form 
of graph, chart or table, 
study it carefully and 
practise picking out the 
major changes that the 
figure shows. Imagine 
that you are explaining 
to someone else what 
you have noticed from 
the graph. 


3 Improving your Task Achievement score 

When the examiner assesses your writing, one of the criteria they will 
use is calk'd Task Achievement. Look at the wording of this Writing 
Task 1 question. 

Summarise the information by selecting and reporting the main 
features, and make comparisons where relevant. 

Write at least 150 words. 

This means that, to achieve a good score for Task Achievement, you 
need to 

1 give an overview of the main information in the graph (summarise 
the information). 

2 describe all the most relevant and significant information (select and 
report the main features). 

3 point out the key differences and similarities in the data (make 
comparisons where relevant). 

4 only include information that is represented in the data. 

5 produce an answer that is at least 150 words.

98 










Writing skills 


For Writing Task 1, you need 10 write 150 words describing and 
summarising (he main features. The visual informal ion may contain 
minor details that should not be included. For example: 



Test Tip You will 
lose marks for Task 
Achievement if you

• leave out data that 
is important. 


Minor detail; Before the new tone iras introduced, almost eight airs had 
accidents <x? the M4 per kilometre per year. 


* speculate on 


reasons for the data. 


3.3 Look at sentences 1-6 and decide if the information is 

A a main feature (it should be included) 

B a minor detail (it can be left out) 

l The M2 and the M3 showed the smallest reduction in accidents. 


• add information not 
included in the data. 


* write less than 150 
words, 


Don't do these things. 


2 Approximately four accidents per kilometre occurred on the - 

M3 prior to the peak lane being introduced. 

3 About 17 accidents per kilometre occurred each year on the 
M2 following the introduction of extra lanes on busy roads. 

4 The greatest reduction in accident numbers occurred on the 
M1, the M4 and the M5, 

5 The introduction of i lit? new system cut the number of 
accidents occurring on the Ml and the M5 by half. 

6 Each year, the greatest number of accidents occur oil the M i,

3.4 Look again at the bar chart in 2.1 and read the model answer 

below. Check the Task Achievement of the model answer, 

1 Find a sentence that gives an overview of the main information. 

2 Find four examples of the main features of the data that have 
been selected and reported. 

3 Check the word count. 

The chart shows the respoises of a group consisting of 1 00 boys. 100 girls and 1 00 adults In 
Manchester, England, when asked whether they participated in four sports: basketball swimming, 
tennis and football, From their responses, it is clear that swimming is the most popular sport 
among all groups, and that from these three groups, boys participated in the most sports, irt fact, 
for three out of the fou r sports, boys were the major partici pants. The on ly sport not enjoyed by 
the boys surveyed was hockey, a sport that the vast majority of the girls who were interviewed 
participated in. Other sports enjoyed by girls wens tennis and basketbal l. However, only a very 
small number, approximately 10 of the 100. participated in football We can conclude from this

2 Academic Writing Task 1 - 
Comparing and contrasting 
graphs and tables 

In this unit you will practise: 

* avoiding repetition 

* comparing and contrasting data 

* describing changes in numbers 

* grammatical range and accuracy 

* describing numbers and figures accurately 


1 Avoiding repetition 

As well as Task Achievement, another criterion the examiner will use 
is called Lexical Resource. This assesses the accuracy and range of die 
vocabulary you use. To display a wide range of vocabulary, you must make 
sure not lo simply repeat your own words or the words from the question. 

1.1 A good way to avoid repetition is to use synonyms. W hich words 

A-F could be used to replace the underlined words in sentences 1-6? 

1 There was a sharp decrease in sales between 2007 and 2010 

2 The figures fell steadily over the next It) years. 

i It is predicted Thai the numbers will begin to increase from 2025. 

4 It is predicted that the numbers will remain t he same for the next 
ten years. 

5 The charts show how many people travelled by train in 1950 
and 2000. 

6 According to the data in the table, 2005 was the most 
successful year. 

A stay 
B indicate 
C information 
D dropped 
E rise 
F reduction 


100 












You need to write an introductory statement for your description. For 
this, it is particularly important to use your own words instead of 
copying words and phrases directly from the question. You can do 
this by 

* using a synonym of the words in the question. 

• changing the form of a wort! (e.g. changing a verb into a noun}. 

1.2 Look at these extracts from Writing Task 1 questions, and 
candidates' introductory statements. Replace the underlined 
words in the candidates' answers with a suitable phrase from 
the box to improve the range of vocabulary.

2 Comparing and contrasting data 

When you are describing a chart or graph, you are actually describing 
the patterns in the data. Before you begin in write, spend one or two 
minutes noticing the different features of the visual information. 


2.1 Look at this Writing Task and then answer the questions.

you need to select and 
report on the main 
features and make 
comparisons where 
relevant 


1 What do ihe figures on the left measure? 

2 Why does the number 1.000 appear twice? 

3 Which set of figures shows what is happening in the country 
as a whole? 

To help identify the patterns, you need to look for the 

■ peaks (high points) and troughs (low points) 

* periods when the figures remain steady (show little or no change) 

* periods when (he figures fluctuate (show a lot of changes) 

You also need to notice which different figures you can compare 
(show that they are similar) and contrast {show that they are different) 


2.2 Look at (he patterns in the data and answer these questions. 

1 Over which span of time did the UK government's wealth 
remain steady? 

2 Over which period did its wealth decline? 

3 In which three separate years did business wealth show a

spend a little time studying and understanding the diagram before you 
begin to write. Remember, you need to include all of the most relevant 
information. 


1.1 Look at the diagram below for one minute. 

How to make recycled paper from old newspapers.

you need to identify 
the most important 
information in oniy one 
or two minutes. To help 
plan your answer, write 
the different verbs you 
will use to describe each 
stage on the diagram 
itself. This will help to 
make sure you don't 
miss out any important 
steps rn your description.

ready to write 


In this unit you will practise: 


understanding the task 

planning and organising 
your ideas 


improving your 
Task Response score 

writing an introduction 


1 Understanding the task 

Wriling Task 2 consists of 

* one or iwo statements on a topic tlR, a direct quotation giving 
someone's opinion on a topic 

* a specific task or question for you to answer 

* the types of idea you need to include in your answer. 


1.1 The words and phrases L~fi are often used in Writing Task 2.

t Children have to be educated, but they also have to be allowed 
to learn tilings for themselves, 

2 'Advertisements spoil our enjoyment of today's entertainment.' 
't think the adverts arc often more enjoyable than the 
programmes they interrupt.' 

3 The world would Ik- a happier place if we all enjoyed our work. 

4 Computers allow us to stay connected with each other. However, 
they also encourage people not to go out and socialise, 

5 Some countries reduce inner-city traffic by increasing public 
transport. Others impose a tax on people who drive in the city. 

6 Nowadays, more people are travelling to remote places, 
spreading their own language and culture as a result. 


Questions 

A What are the advantages 
and disadvantages of 
each system? 

B Discuss both statements 
and give your own 
opinion. 

C To what extent do you 
think this is a positive 
trend? 

D How realistic do you 
think this is? 

E To what extent do you 
agree or disagree with 
this view? 


119 








Writing skills 


2 Planning and organising your ideas 

Before you begin to write, it's important to make a plan. If you don't 
do this, your ideas will be disorganised and you will lose marks. 

Step 7: decide on your own position or attitude 

2.1 Look a! the statements from 1.2 again. 

1 For statements I, 3 and 6, decide how much you agree. 

2 For the statements in 2, 4 and 5, decide which one you agree with. 

3 For each of the statements in 1 .2, explain why you agree or 
disagree. Then give your own opinion on the topic. 

2.2 Study the following Writing Task 2 question. 

The internet allows us to stay connected with each other no 
matter where we are. On the other hand, it also isolates us and 
encourages people not to socialise. 

To what extent do you agree or disagree with these statements? 

Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant 
examples from your own knowledge or experience. 



Test Tip The score you 
get for Writing Task 2 
is two thirds of your 
total writing score, so 
it is very important that 
you spend a full 40 
minutes on this part 
of the IE ITS Writing 
paper. You are given 
more time than for 
Writing Task 1 because 
you need to write 
250 words, and also 
because you have to 
use your own ideas 
Spend at least four or 
five minutes planning 
your ideas before you 
start writing. 


The final pan of the question is very important. It lells you vvhai you must 
include In your answer. 


You must include 

• your own opinion aboul the 
statements. 

* the reasons lor your opinion. 


You can include 

* examples from your own personal 
experience, but these must be 
rclevam to the question. 


2.3 Look at the question in 2.2 again. 

1 Decide on your own point of view. 

2 Think about your own personal experience of this topic. Make notes. 

My own opinions and experience 


120 











Step 2: note down any ideas about the topic 

The examiner will mark your Writing Task 2 based on specific criteria. 
One of these is Task Response. To achieve a good Task Response score, 
you must 

* explain your own opinions on the topic 

* support your opinions (e.g. with personal examples or your 
knowledge of the world]! 

* include only relevant ideas 

* write 250 words, 

2.4 You w ill lose marks if you include ideas that are not relevant to 
the question. Look at these ideas that a candidate noted to 
answer the question in 2.2. Cross out four ideas that are not 
relevant to the task and should not be included.

2.5 Check your answers, then look back ai your own ideas from 2.5. 
Arc there any you need 10 cross out? 

B Study Tip Articles that contain opinions can help give you ideas to use 
in the Writing tasks. The letters page of a newspaper usually contains 
people's personal opinions about different topics. Read them and decide 
whether you agree or disagree. Decide what your own opinion is. 













Writing skills 


Step 3: organise your ideas into paragraphs 

It is important to produce a balanced answer that looks at both sides 
of ilie question equally, li is also important to organise your ideas into 
separate paragraphs. 

2.6 Decide which of the remaining ideas from 2.4 can be pul 

together into the same paragraph. Put the ideas from 2,4 into the 
correct box below. 


For: the internet helps us to 
stay connected: 

Against: the internet isolates us 




Step 4; check that you have enough ideas 

If you do not have enough ideas for both sides of the question, then 
your ideas will not be fully developed. 


Test Tip Your answer 
will also be marked 
on coherence (are 
your ideas clearly 
linked?}. You need to 
make sure your ideas 
are organised into 
separate paragraphs. 

To help group your 
ideas together logically, 
make notes under 
different headings that 
show both sides of the 
discussion. These can 
then form the middle 
paragraphs of your 
answer. 


2.7 Which side of the argument do we need to add more to? 


2.8 Which of the following ideas would be best to add? 

A The business world benefits from the immediate contaci 
provided by the Internet. 

B The internet has both advantages and disadvantages. 

3 Getting started - writing an introduction 

Once you have your ideas planned out, you can begin to write. Your 
answer must be clearly developed, and so it needs a clear start. The 
best way to start is by restating the question in your own words. 


3.1 Match introductory sentences A-D below to Writing Task 2 
statements 1-6 in 1.2. 

A Each year, there are more and more cars on our streets creating 
congestion and causing delays. There are Several ways that 
local governments can try to solve these problems, 

B Unless we are born into wealth, we all need to find a way to 
earn a living. Fur many, our working life takes up most of our 
waking hours ami this can make us very unhappy indeed. 

C As a society, we have a duty to teach our young people. However, 
there .ire some lessons that we need to learn for ourselves. 

D Marketing involves teaching as many people as possible about 
a product. There is no better way to reach people than through 
television, popular culture and the internet.

Writing skills 


3.2 In i his introduction for the Writing Task in i.2, too many words 
have been copied from the question. Improve the Introduction by 
replacing the underlined phrases. Use the words from the box.

Once you have restated the question, the rest of your introduction could 

1 give your interpretation of the words or ideas used in the 
question 

2 explain what you intend to write about 

3 give a brief reaction to the question 

4 summarise the question or topic through a new question 

3.3 What suggestions above ( 1-4) do sentences A-D relate to? 

A Does the internet really help us to develop relationships? 

13 We need to consider both the benefits and the drawbacks of 
the internet. 

C I think the word 'tool' is important here. In my view- it shows 
how impersonal this contact is. 

D These statements summarise my own mixed feelings towards 
the internet. 


I Test Tip You will 

lose marks if you 
copy words from the 
question. Make sure to 
paraphrase the ideas. 


3.4 Look at sentences 1-4 below and decide which would make a 
good filial sentence for the introduction. 

1 It seems clear that the internet brings a lot of problems. 

2 Is the internet a positive or a negative influence on our lives? 

3 How can we ensure that the internet does not cause widespread 
problems? 

4 Let us consider the arguments for and against computers. 

i Study Tip Don't learn whole answers and expect to use them in the 

exam. You will receive a very low score if you do this. Candidates who 
receive a higher band score in writing are able to show flexible use of 
language. The more you practise writing and reading, the more flexible 
your writing will become.

and ideas together. Put them into the correct place in the list, 
according to how they are used.

plural noun) 

* using a group noun (This/thesetypefs) of t kitid(s) of + noun) 


For example

you need to avoid 
repeating words from 
the question and use as 
wide a variety of words 
and phrases to discuss 
the topic as you can.

to live but they often lack hospitals, shops and schools. Living 
without easy access to hospitals, shops and schools can make 
life very difficult indeed. 

3 Governments sometimes try to encourage innovation hv 
offering grants. This isn't always effective because special g rants 
arc often difficult to obtain. 

4 Some teachers ask students to simply copy down texts from a 
blackboard. But co pying down texts does not help students to 
become independent or flexible in their use of language.

S Study Tip Think about, your own language when you are studying 

English, Make a note of important differences such as vocabulary or 
grammar. Noticing these will help you to avoid making the mistakes that 
are common for people with the same first language as you.

mistakes and correct them, 

1 In conclusion, I completely disagree this view, 

2 As far as I am concern, this is a problem without any real solution. 

3 To summarise, even I here is a dear downside to our dependence 
on technology, I honestly feel we have to find a way to cope 
with it because the internet is definitely here to stay. 

4 In conclude, there are both negatives and positives to this 
system, but the negatives seem lo far outweigh the positives.

Television in jeneraI is one of the most important tosls of our daily life 
noM. From children to adults, every age group enjoys watching the television 
programmes of their interest, TV In its early days was mainly used for news 
broadcasting and other important awareness for the public. But now if heavily 
influences our lives and it almost became an addiction. 

In today s world, with the discovery of satellite television, almost every 
channel reaches our home and we have plenty of choice. In my opinion 
TV plays a great role in our lives as its a major source of information of 
happenings around the world and one has enough Information about another 
country before they have a chance to visit the place physically. In today'* 
household one keeps track of programmes and can record them to watch 
it at a later more convenient time. So TV is not only a great tool for the 
enhancement of knowledge on every subject but also its an entertainment 
package as without it life would be very dull and monotonous. 


NowdayS, with the developing of science and technology, moreen more 
people use computers, computers are getting popular people use computer 
to tapy their espies, get information from internet and computers are 
used in everywhere such as bank superrtiaket arid so on. however ft has 
been widely noted that some people don't know how to use computers, it 
make them inconvenient and uncomfortable in their lives, people who do 
not know how to use compute are become more and more disadvantaged. 
Some people believe that government should make means to solve this 
problem, In my opinion, people who don't know how to use computers make 
them disadvantaged in three ways. 


C 


Nowadays, technology is an esstentiat part of education. 
The use of computers in a classroom is so common that 
it is almost impossible to students jo How tKeir studies if 
they do not have computer shills, However, if the computer 
dominate the major role of education, what should be 
done with the teachers? 


Firstly, not all schools can provide computers for their 
students. In this ease, colleges sitaatedfar away from big 
center or better, in small towns, depend on teachers as the 
main source of knowledgejbr their children Another point 
to be considered is the fact that not all the students are 
keen on working with computers or have enough skills to 
work with these modem machines.

closer to a description of your own writing?

2.2 Boltsw there are some examples of good coherence from 

Melanie's talk. The words and phrases she uses to connect her 
ideas are in bold. Complete extracts 1-8 with endings A-H. 

A | decided to take English lessons. 

B I helped him 
C I could help him a little. 

D he couldn't speak English at all.

2.4 It is important to use a variety of language. Do you think 
Melanie uses a variety of connecting words and phrases or does 
she repeal the same ones? 

2.5 Melanie also connects her ideas using pronouns. Look again at 
the sentence endings A-H and highlight all of the pronouns. 

Fluency refers to the speed of your delivery and how hesitant you are. 
Candidates who are hesitant often say er ... a lot.

fluency. 

1 What words and phrases does Saida use to link her ideas? 

2 What other connecting words could Saida have used? 
i Does she use pronouns? 

4 Does Saida talk fluenity. or is she quite hesitant? 

3 Organising your notes and your talk 

Making notes can help you to plan your ideas and to give you a fresh 
start during your talk. Vour notes will help you to 

• start you thinking about the topic. 

• organise your ideas (improve your coherence). 

• keep going during your talk (improve your fluency). 


3.1 Read this Part 2 task and look at two different candidates' notes. 


Describe a person who has been an important influence in your life. 
You should say 

who this person is and how long you have known him or her 
why you chose this person 
how this person has influenced your life 
and explain how you feel about him or her. 


Candidate 1 


Who and how long? o Iderbroth er/ 36yearsold/a lawyer/ 
lives in America / not see often / known him all my life 

Why I chose him when young had problems at school /learning 
difficulties / his dream - to he a lawyer/failed many times / finally 
succeeded 

How he has influenced my life taught me to keep going / 
have a dear goal / don't give up / last year; I failed important test / 
disappointed but didn't give up / trying again soon 

My feelings grateful / admiration/ proud 


Test Tip When you 
are making your notes, 
try not to write too 
much. It is important 
to use this time to 
think and note down 
ideas or words, but you 
also need to be able 
to quickly look at your 
notes during your talk 
and easily find vour 
next idea. Try to find a 
way that helps you do 
this (e,g. organise your 
ideas clockwise on your 
page, rather than in a 
random order). 


143

Why? Looked after 
me when young - 
parents working 


/ 


3 Influence - calm, taught 
me to read & write, to work 
hard, about my culture 


3.2 Think about your own notes. 

1 Wiren you make notes, do you write them 
A in a list? 

B scattered randomly on the page? 

C in a mind map or diagram? 

2 Do you write 

A single words? 

II long phrases? 

C whole sentences? 

3 Try u> decide which style of notes would he most helpful for 
you during the exam. 

3.3 Use the two sets of notes in 3,1 to give a talk about the different 
people. Use all of the details, and time yourself. Concentrate on 
connecting your ideas and use the ideas below to help you. 

• I've decided to talk about ... 

• I've known him/her 

* 1 chose him/her because ... 

♦ ] think s/he lias influenced my life by ... 

* When 1 think of him/her, I feel ,,. 

3.4 Choose the style of notes von led most comfortable with and 
write detailed notes about a person who has influenced you. 
Then, give a talk about him or her. Make sure you time yourself. 
Record or video yourself if possible. 

3.5 Were your notes helpful? Did you write ioo much or not enough? 

3.6 Answer (he rounding-off question below. Try to expand on your 
answers in the same way as Sanem and Emanuclc did. 

• Who do you think lias the most influence in your life; your 
family or your friends? Why?

Part 3 - Talking about 
abstract topics 

In thfs unit you will practise: 

* talking about abstract topics * agreeing and disagreeing 

* giving your personal opinion * improving your Lexical 

Resource score 


1 Talking about abstract topics 

In Parts i and 2 of the Speaking test, the topics and questions are familiar 
and personal. In Part 3, the topics and questions are more general and more 
abstract. The questions gradually become more difficult. 


1.1 video Listen to how the examiner introduces Pari J. Complete 
the paragraph below. You may need lo watch more than once. 


It

examiner's questions 


to make sure that you 


answer them fully and 


appropriately.

Test Tip In each part 
of the test, it is very 
important to answer 
all of the questions as 
fully as possible so that 
the examiner can assess 
your language. This 
will also help improve 
your score. Make sure 
to expand on your 
answers as much as 
possible.

Match ihe extracts 1-8 from his answers 10 questions A-H. 

1 [ think governments should create ... the right base. 

2 Bill sometimes 1 understand that it's difficult to help some 
people. 

3 You may have a problem some day and ii there is someone that 
can help you, it's a good thing. 

4 1 think the most common action you can do would be to Send 
him something he doesn't have. 

5 l ife in cities is quite stressful. 

6 1 think that everyone should help each other first, then the 
government can create the structure and can act in the right 
wav to allow people to be helpful, 

7 I think it depends on the country- For example, the experience 
1 had here in England showed me that people are much more 
heipfui here* 

8 You should always try to be helpful because you can't base 
your attitude on a past experience. 

1 .4 Emanuele gave full answers lo the questions. Look ai ihese 

techniques for expanding on your answers in Part 3. 

Techniques 

A stating or explaining your own view 
B giving relevant examples 
C explaining how or why something happens 
D saying what would, could, should or might happen 
E suggesting a solution to a problem

1.7 The questions In Part 3 often ask for your opinion. Look til (he 

questions J-5 and answer them in your own words. Make sure 

you expand on your answer using techniques from 1,4, 

1 Do you think it's more important to earn a large salary or to be 
happy in your job? 

2 Do you think some people spend too much lime on their 
computers these days? (Why?) 

3 Do you think the government should try to control the internet, 
or should people be able to write whatever they want? 

4 Pollution is a problem in many countries. What do you think 
governments can do about it? 

5 Do you think newspapers and books will eventually disappear? 


Test Tip For Part 3, 
it is important to have 
your own opinion. Try 
to read newspapers and 
watch the news to keep 
up with Current issues. 


2 Agreeing and disagreeing 

2.1 Sometimes the examiner will give you an opinion and then ask 
'Would you agree with that?' Look at the following responses to 
this queslion. Put the different answers into the correct column 


according to their meaning. 

1 Oh no r not at all. 

2 Well, I think there are valid 
points for both. 

3 I totally agree with that. 

4 I think I would probably have 
to say no. 

5 To a certain extent, yes. 


6 I completely disagree, 

7 l can see your point, but... 

8 Yes, I think that's absolutely 
right. 

9 Actually, J think it depends on 
the situation/country/person 

10 It seems to me that there are 
two sides to consider. 


Test Tip Don't be 
afraid to disagree 
with the opinions the 
examiner expresses. 
These are not 
necessarily what the 
examiner thinks or 
believes. It is simply 
a chance for you 
to showcase your 
language and ideas.

3 Improving your Lexical Resource score 

Another of the criteria your examiner will use to assess your speaking 
is called Lexical Resource. You will score well if you use a wide range 
of vocabulary and don't limit yourself to basic words and phrases. 
During the Speaking test, try not to repeat the same words too often 
and use some Idiomatic expressions if you can, 


giasulELTS.vn 

3,1 Create idiomatic expressions by completing phrases 1-6 with 
endings A-F. 


1 I felt as though I didn't have 

2 I couldn't keep 

3 Actions speak 

4 My boss was 

5 My sister and I arc like 

6 You can t judge a book 


A louder than words. 

B a bit of a slave driver. 
C a care in the world, 

D by its cover, 

E a straight face. 

F two peas in a pod. 


3,2 Match the completed expressions in 5.1 with die correct meaning. 


A I was made to work very hard. 

15 We're very similar. 

C A ppea ra n ces can be deceiving. 
d i was very relaxed. 

E What we do matters more than what we say. 
F I found it difficult not to laugh. 


3,3 Below are some words/phrases that Emanuele used in Part 3. 

Are they basic or higher-level vocabulary? Circle the higher-level 
words.

4 Checking, correcting and 
assessing 

In this unit you will practise: 

• dealing with problems 

• pronunciation and intonation 

■ running words together (chunking) 

• assessing your level 


1 Dealing with problems 


1,1 video 14 Watch five extracts from different interviews 
and decide which of the problems (A-D) each candidate is 
experiencing. There may be more than one possible answer and 
you may use any letter more than once- 

Problems 

A the candidate doesn't understand the question 
B the candidate hasn't heard the question properly 
C the candidate has made a mistake 
D t he ca nd id a te isn r t sure h ow to a nswer 


1 Em a mi etc: 4 Saida: 

2 Saida: 5 Melanie: 

1 Melanie: 


Test Tip Listen 
carefully to the 
examiner's questions 
to make sure that you 
answer them fully and 
appropriately. Don't be 
too shy to ask for help 
in the interview if you 
need it. 


1.2 Watch again and notice how the candidate responds to the 
problem. Choose the correct letter (A-D). 

Candidate’s response to the problem 

A the candidate stays silent 
B the candidate attempts an answer but is hesitant 
C the candidate asks a question to check 
D the candidate corrects hmutierself 


1.3 Which of these ways of dealing with problems do you think 
could give you a lower mark? Why? 


1.4 What did the examiner do in extracts I and 2 io help keep the 
candidate talking? 


149 




















Speaking skills 


1,5 Here are some useful phrases you can use to deal with problems 
in ihe test. Match the phrases to the problems <A-D) in M, You 
can use any of the phrases more than once. 

| -■- 

Sorry, l meant to say ... l J m sorry, could you repeat the question? 
I honestly have no idea. t'm not really sure what you mean. 

I've never really thought about that before. 


2 Pronunciation, intonation and 'chunking 1 


Study Tip If you are unsure which individual sounds you are saying 
incorrectly, try reading a short passage from this book aloud and asking 
another student to write down what you say. Are there any words or 
sounds that they have difficulty understanding? Or, record yourself and 
listen back. How easy is it to write what you hear? 


The fourth criterion your examiner will use to assess your English 
level is Pronunciation, This includes: 


* pronouncing individual sounds clearly. 

* using intonation and stress to help communicate your ideas. 

* 'chunking' (running your words together naturally and clearly - not 
in a robotic way). 

Individual sounds 


Hearing the difference between sounds you find difficult can be the 
first step to saying them correctly. 


34 To help you identify which English sounds you may have 
a problem with, listen and circle the word that you hear.

problems can you hear with individual sounds? 

Stress, intonation, and running words together

Speaking skills 


Stress is also used to give emphasis to a word and add extra meaning 10 it. 

2.10 ► 38 You will hear pan of a talk about conducting a job 

interview'. As you listen, follow the script below and underline 
the words that the speaker stresses to give emphasis. 

Over the years It I've interviewed hundreds of candidates N for jobs 
at many different levels, il The point of every job interview is to 
make sure a candidate has the skills necessary to do the work. Hiring 
the wrung person can be an expensive mistake. But, apart from 
references, how can you determine il the candidate actually knows 
what he says he knows? A very effective way to sort out the good 
candidates from the bad is by asking 'How did you do that?' and 
'Why did you do that?' at appropriate stages in the interview. 


Intonation is an important part of your pronunciation. Good intonation 
stops your speech sounding too monotonous. 

Chunking, or running words together, also helps to make your language 
sound more natural. 

2.1 1 The first few lines of the script above have ft marks to show how 
the speaker chunks words and phrases together. Listen again and 
add U marks to show where the speaker naturally pauses, 

2.12 Look at this extract from Sanem’s video and say it aloud, 

1 underline the words that you think should be stressed 

2 use it marks to show which phrases or groups of words should be 
chunked together. 

EXAMINER: Let's talk about music. How often do you listen to music? 

SANEM: Every day. I love music, yeah I 'm a fan of music every type of 
music especially rock music and classical music and I like to search from the 
internet, new groups, new bands, new type of genres, Yeah, every day 


2.13 Video 16 Watch the extract from Sanem's video. 

1 Does she show a good use of stress and chunking? 

2 Does she show a good use of intonation or does she sound 
monotonous? 


Study Tip A good way to practise intonation and fluency is by copying 
the rhythm of native speakers. Choose a recording from the listening 
section and play it at a low volume. Read aioud from the script and try 
to keep the same time and intonation patterns as the speaker on the 
recording.

3 Assessing yourself and improving your score 

B Study Tip Record yourself being interviewed, on video if possible, and 
try to assess your own performance. Decide which areas you need to 
work on and improve. 


3.1 video 17 Watch the whole of Saida's lest. As you watch, Jook 
at the comments made by an examiner below and the score site 
received. 


Criteria 

Examiner comments 

Band awarded 

Fluency and 
Cohesion 

Slow speech and frequent hesitation. A range of spoken 
discourse markers {well: so: it depends; actually: 1 think so; first 
of alt). 

5 

Lexical 

Resource 

Some good vocabulary [architectural design, last two decades, 
cooperative and tolerant, look after their children, help people 
become healthy again), but limited flexibility is demonstrated 
by lack of range, repetition of certain items ( cooperative and 
tolerant) and irrappropriates (it's very actual, some cookings and 
housekeeping works, she always says me). 

Between a 5 and 6 
(so 5.5) 

Grammatical 
Range and 
Accuracy 

Quite accurate on basic forms, but tittle range. Some good 
examples or complex forms (help people to become healthy 
again, try to encourage it. 1 prefer to write letters by myself, my 
mother asked me to go to her home and help), but most of these 
involve infinitive structures. Examples of errors ( technology 
nowdays are really go fast, she become healthy, now 1 proud, 
they are more closer, think about yoursetves/themselves). 

However, in general, these do not impede communication. 

Between a 5 and a 6 
(so 5.5) 

Pronunciation 

At limes, her slow speech interferes with chunking and rhythm 
and she has a problem with *th’. However, control is variable 
and when more confident, she demonstrates good rhythm and 
chunking (if 1 can help someone, explain some things which 1 
want to say) and has some good use of intonation and stress 
(not only nurses, also teachers).

3.2 Saida's overall score was 5.5. Look at the comments again and 
decide what Saida would need to do to improve her band scores 
for each of the criteria.

The Dover Bronze-Age Boat 

A beautifully preserved boat, made around 3.000 years ago and discovered by chance in a 
muddy hole, has had a profound impact on archaeological research. 


It was 1S#)2, In England, workmen were building a 
new road through the heart of Dover, to connect 
the ancient port and the Channel 'Daniel, which, 
when it opened just t wo years later, was to be the 
first land link between Britain and Europe for over 
10,000 years, A small team from the Canterbury 
Archaeological Trust (CAT) worked alongside the 
workmen, recording new discoveries brought to 
light by the machines. 

At the base of a deep shaft six metres below the 
modem streets a wooden structure was revealed. 
Cleaning away tile waterlogged site overlying the 
limbers, archaeologists realised its true nature. 
They had found a prehistoric boat, preserved by 
the type of sediment in which it was buried. It was 
then named the Dover Bronze-Age Boat. 

About nine metres of the boai’s length was 
recovered; one end lay beyond the excavation and 
had to lie left. What survived consisted essentially 
of four intricately carved oak planks: two on 
the bottom, joined along a central seam by a 
complicated system of wedges and timbers, ami 
two at the side, curved mid stitched to the others. 
The seams had been made watertight by pads of 
moss, lixed by wedges and yew stitches. 

The timber thal closed die recovered end 
of the boat had been removed in antiquity when 
it was abandoned, but much about its original 
shape could be deduced. There was also evidence 
for missing upper side planks. The boat was not 


a wreck, bul had been deliberately discarded, 
dismantled and broken. Perhaps it had been 
’ritually killed' at the end of its life, like other 
Bronze-Age objects. 

With hindsight, it was significant that the 
boat was found ami studied by mainstream 
archaeologists who naturally focused on its 
cultural context. At the time, ancient boats 
we lie often considered only from a narrower 
technological perspective, but news about the 
Dover boat reached a broad audience. In 2002, on 
the tenth anniversary of llie discovery, the Dover 
Bronze-Age Boat TYust hosted a conference, 
where (his meeting of different traditions became 
apparent. Alongside technical papers about the 
boat, other speakers explored its social and 
economic contexts, and the religious perceptions 
or boats in Bronze-Age societies. Many speakers 
came from overseas, and debate about cultural 
connections was renewed. 

Within seven years of excavation, the Dover 
boat had been conserved and displayed, but it 
was apparent that there were issues that could 
not be resolved simply by studying the old 
wood. Experimental archaeology seemed io lie 
the solution: a boat reconstruction, half-scale 
or full-sized, would permit assessment of the 
different hypotheses regarding its build ami the 
missing end. The possibility of reluming to Dover 
to search for the boat’s unexcavated northern

end was explored, hut practical and financial 
difficulties were insurmountable - and there was 
no guarantee that the timbers had survived the 
previous decade in the changed environment. 

Detailed proposals to reconstruct the boat 
were drawn up in 2004. Archaeological evidence 
was beginning to suggest a Bronze-Age community 
straddling the Channel, brought together by the 
sea, rather than separated by ir. in a region today 
divided by languages and borders, archaeologists 
had a duly to inform the general public about their 
common cultural heritage. 

The boat project began in England but it 
was conceived from the stall as a European 
collaboration. Reconstruction was only part of 
a scheme that would include a major exhibition 
and an extensive educational and outreach 
programme. Discussions began early in 2005 with 
archaeological bodies, universities and heritage 
organisations either side of the Channel. There 
was much enthusiasm and support, and an official 
launch of the project was held at an international 
seminar in France in 2007. Financial support w;is 
confirmed in 2008 and the project then named 
BOAT 1550BC got under way in June 2011, 


A small team began lo make the boat at the start 
of 2012 on the Roman J^iwn outside Dover museum. 
A full-scale reconstruction of a mid-section had 
Ix'cn made let 1906, primarily lo see how Bronze- 
Age replica tools performed. In 2012, however, the 
hull shape w as al the centre of the work, so modem 
power tools were used to carve the oak planks, 
before turning to prehistoric tools for finishing. 

It was decided to make the replica half-scale for 
reasons of cost and time, and synthetic materials 
were used for the stitching, owing to doubts about 
the settling mid tight timetable. 

Meanwhile, the exhibition was being prepared 
ready for opening in July 2012 at the Castle 
Museum in Boulogne sur-Mer. Entitled 'Beyond 
the Horizon: Societies of t he Channel A Norih 
Sea 3,500 years ago', it brought together for the 
first time a remarkable collection of Bronze-Age 
objects, including many new discoveries for 
commercial archaeology and some of the great 
treasure of the piist. The reconstructed boat, as a 
symbol of the maritime connections lhal bound 
together the communities either side of the 
Channel, was the centrepiece.

The changing role of airports 


Airports continue to diversify their role in an effort to generate income. 

Are business meeting facilities the next step? Nigel Halpern. Anne Graham 
and Rob Davidson investigate. 

A 

In recent times developing commercial revenues has become more challenging for airports 
due to a combination of factors, such as increased competition from Internet shopping, 
restrictions cm certain sales, such as tobacco, and new security procedures that have had 
an impact on the dwell time of passengers. Moreover, the global economic downturn has 
caused a reduction in passenger numbers while those that are travelling generally have less 
money to spend. This has meant that the share of revenue from non-aeronautical revenues 
actually peaked at 54% at the turn of the century and has subsequently declined slightly. 
Meanwhile, the pressures to control the level of aeronautical revenues are as strong as 
ever due to the poor financial health of many airlines and the rapid rise of the low-cost 
carrier sector, 

B 

Some of the more obvious solutions to growing commercial revenues, such as extending 
the merchandising space or expanding the variety of shopping opportunities, have already 
been tried to their limit at many airports. A more radical solution is to find new sources of 
commercial revenue within the terminal, end this has been explored by many airports over 
the last decade or so. As a result, many terminals are now much more than just shopping 
malls and offer an array of entertainment, leisure, and beauty and wellness facilities. At this 
stage of facilities provision, the airport also has the possibility of taking on the role of the 
final destination rather than merely a facilitator of access. 

C 

At the same time, airports have been developing and- expanding the range of services that 
they provide specifically for the business traveller in the terminal. This includes offering 
business centres that supply support services, meeting or conference rooms and other 
space for special events. Within this context, Jarach (20013 discusses how dedicated 
meetings facilities located within the terminal and managed directly by the airport operator 
may be regarded as an expansion of the concept of airline lounges or as a way to reconvert 
abandoned or underused areas of terminal buildings. Previously it was primarily airport 
hotels and other facilities offered in the surrounding area of the airport that had the 
potential to take on this role and become active as a business space (McNeill. 2009], 


163 














Test 1 


D 

When an airport location can be promoted as a business venue, this may increase the 
overall appeal of the airport and help it become more competitive in bath attracting and 
retaining airlines and their passengers. In particular, the presence of meeting facilities could 
become one of the determining factors taken into consideration when bueiness people are 
choosing airlines and where they change their planes. This enhanced attractiveness itself 
may help to improve the airport operator’s financial position and future prospects, but 
clearly this will be dependent on the competitive advantage that the airport is able to achieve 
in comparison with other venues. 

E 

In 3011, an online airport Survey was conducted and some of the areas investigated 
included the provision and use of meeting facilities at airports and the perceived role and 
importance of these facilities in generating income and raising passenger numbers. In 
total, there were responses from staff at 154 airports and 68% of these answered 'yes' 
to the question: Does your airport own and have meetings facilities available for hire? 

The existence of meeting facilities therefore seems high at airports. In addition, 28% of 
respondents that did not have meeting facilities stated that they were likely to invest in them 
during the next five years. The survey also asked to what extent respondents agreed or 
disagreed with a number of statements about the meeting facilities at their airport. 49% 
of respondents agreed that they have put more investment into them during recent years: 
41% egreed that they would invest more in the immediate future. These are fairly high 
proportions considering the recent economic climate. 

F 

The survey also asked airports with meeting facilities to estimate what proportion of users 
are from the local area, i,e. within a 90-minute drive from the airport, or from abroad. 

Their findings show that meeting facilities provided by the majority of respondents tend to 
serve local versus non-local or foreign needs. 63% of respondents estimated that over 
60% of users are from the local: area. Only 3% estimated that over 00% of users are from 
abroad. It is therefore not surprising that the facilities are of limited importance when it 
comes to increasing use of Flights at the airport: 16% of respondents estimated that none 
of the users of their meeting facilities use flights when travelling to or from them, while 56% 
estimated that 20% or fewer of the users of their facilities use flights. 

G 

The survey asked respondents with meeting facilities to estimate how much revenue their 
airport earned from its meeting facilities during the last financial year. Average revenue 
per airport was just $12,359, Meeting facilities are effectively □ non-aeronautical source 
of airport revenue. Only 1% of respondents generated more than 20% non-aeronautical 
revenue from their meetings facilities; none generated more than 40%. Given the focus on 
local demand, it is not surprising that less than a third of respondents agreed that their 
meeting facilities support business and tourism development in their home region 
or country. 

H 

The findings of thie study suggest that few airports provide meetings facilities as a serious 
commercial venture. It may he that, as owners of large property, space is availahle for 
meeting facilities at airports and could play an important role in serving the needs of the 
airport, its partners, and stakeholders such as government and the local community. Thus, 
while the local orientation means that competition with other airports is likely to be minimal, 
competition with local providers of meetings facilities is likely to be much greater.

You should spend about 20 minutes on Questions 27-40. which are based on Reading 
Passage 3 below. 


IS PHOTOGRAPHY ART? 


This may seem a pointless question today. 
Surrounded as we are by thousands of 
photographs, most of us take for granted 
ihat, in addition to supplying information 
and seducing customers, camera images 
also serve as decoration, afford spiritual 
enrichment, and provide significant insights 
into the passing scene. But in the decades 
following the discovery of photography, this 
10 question roller led the search for ways to fit 
the mechanical medium into the traditional 
Schemes of artistic expression. 

The much-publicized pronoun cement 
by painter Paul Delarochc that the 
daguerreotype* signalled the end of painting 
is perplexing because this clever artist also 
forecast the usefulness of the medium for 
graphic artists in a letter written in 1839. 
Nevertheless, it is symptomatic of the 
20 swing between the outright rejection and 
qualified acceptance of the medium that was 
fairly typical of the artistic establishment. 
Discussion of the role of photography in art 
was especially spirited in France, where the 
internal policies of the time had created a 
large pool of artists, hut it was also taken 
op by important voices in Rngland. In both 
countries, public interest in this topic was a 
reflection of the belief that national stature 
30 and achievement in the arts were related. 

From the maze of conflicting statements and 
healed articles oil the subject, three main 
positions about the potential of camera art 
emerged.The simplest, entertained by many 
painters and a section of the public, was that 
photographs should not be considered art' 
because they were made with a mechanieal 
device and by physical and chemical 
phenomena instead of by human hand and 
40 spirit; to some, camera images seemed to 
have more in common with fabric produced 
by machinery in a null than with handmade 
creations fired by inspiration. The second 


widely held view, shared by painters, some 
photographers, and some critics, was that 
photographs would be useful to art hut should 
not he considered equal in erealiveness to 
drawing and painting. Lastly, by assuming 
that the process was comparable to other 
techniques such as etching and lithography. 50 
a fair number of individuals realized that 
camera images were or could be as significant 
as handmade works of art and that they might 
have a positive influence on the arts and on 
culture in general. 

Artists reacted to photography in various 
ways. Many portrait painters - miniaturists 
in particular - who realized that photography 
represented (lie 'handwriting on the wall' 
became involved with daguerreotyping or 6Q 
paper photography in an effort to save their 
careers; some incorporated it with painting, 
white <nhers renounced painting altogether. 

Still other painters, the most prominent 
among them the French painter. Jeaii- 
Auguste-Dominique Ingres, began almost 
immediately to use photography to make it 
record of their own output and also to provide 
themselves with source material for poses and 
backgrounds, vigorously denying at the same 70 
time its influence on their vision or its claims 
as art. 

The view that photographs might he 
worthwhile to artists was enunciated in 
considerable detail by Lacan and Francis 
Why. The latter, an art and literary critic, who 
eventually recognised that camera images 
could he inspired as well as informative, 
su gg ested that they would lead to greater 
naturalness in the graphic depiction of so 

anatomy, clothing, likeness, expression, 
and landscape. By studying photographs, 
true artists, he claimed, would be relieved 
of mental lasks and become free In devote 
themselves to the more important spiritual 
aspects of their work. 


167 




Test 1 


YVey Left unstated what the incompetent artist 
might do as an alternative, but according 
to the influential French critic and poet 
90 Charles Baudelaire, writing in response to 
an exhibition of photography in IS59, lazy 
and untalenled painters would become 
photographers, Fired by a belief in art as 
an imaginative embodiment of cultivated 
ideas and dreams, Baudelaire regarded 
photography as a very humble servant of 
art and science’; a medium largely unable to 
transcend ‘external reality*. For this critic, 
photography was linked with ‘the great 
190 industrial madness' of I fir Lime, whirl] in his 
eyes exercised disastrous consequences fin 
the spiritual qualities of life and art. 

Eugene Delacroix was the most prominent of 
the 1 French artists who welcomed photography 
as help-mate but recognized its limitations. 
Regretting that ‘such a wonderful invention’ 
had arrived so late in his lifetime, hr still 
took lessons in dagtierreolyping, and both 
commissioned and collected photographs, 
no Delacroix’s enthusiasm for the medium ran 
be sensed in a journal entry noting that if 
photographs were used as they should be. an 
artist might 'raise himself to heights that we 
do not yet know'. 

The question of whether the photograph was 
document or art aroused interest in England 


also. The most important statement on this 
matter was an unsigned article that concluded 
that while photography had a role to play, it 
should not be 'constrained' into 'competition' 120 
with art: a more stringent viewpoint led critic 
Philip Gilbert Hamcnon to dismiss camera 
images as ‘narrow in range, emphatic in 
assertion, telling one truth for ten falsehoods'. 

These writers reflected the opposition of a 
section of the cultural elite in England and 
France to the ‘cheapening of art' which the 
growing acceptance and purchase of camera 
pictures by the middle class represented. 
Technology made photographic images a 1 30 

common sight in the shop windows of Begem 
Street and Piccadilly in London and the 
commercial boulevards of Paris. In London, 
for example, there were at the lime some 130 
commercial establishments where portraits, 
landscapes, and photographic reproductions 
of works of art could be bought.This appeal 
to the middle class convinced the elite that 
photographs would foster a desire for realism 
instead of idealism, even though some critics 140 
recognized that the work of individual 
photographers might display an uplifting style 
and substance that was consistent with the 
defining characteristics of art.

The Flavor of Pleasure 

When it comes to celebrating the flavor of food, our mouth gets all the credit 
But in truth , it is the nose that knows , 


No matter how much we talk about tasting our 
favorite flavors, relishing them really depends on a 
combined input from our senses that we experience 
through mouth, tongue and nose. The taste, texture, 
and feel of food are what we tend to focus on, but 
most important are the slight puffs of air as we chew 
our food - what scientists call 'retronasal smell: 

Certainly, our mouths and tongues have taste buds, 
which are receptors for the five basic flavors: sweet, 
salty, sour, bitter, and umamr, or what is more 
commonly referred to as savory. But our tongues are 
inaccurate instruments as far as flavor is concerned. 
They evolved to recognise only a few basic tastes in 
order to quickly identify toxins, which in nature are 
often quite bitter or acidly sour. 

All the complexity, nuance, and pleasure of flavor come 
from the sense of smell operating in the back of the 
nose. It is there that a kind of alchemy occurs when we 
breathe up and out the passing whiffs of our chewed 
food. Unlike a hound's skull with its extra long nose, 
which evolved specifically to detect external smells, our 
noses have evolved to detect internal scents. Primates 
specialise in savoring the many millions of flavor 
combinations that they can create for their mouths. 

Taste without retronasal smell is not much 
help in recognising flavor. Smell has been the 
most poorly understood of our senses, and only 
recently has neuroscience, ted by Yale University's 
Gordon Shepherd, begun to shed light on its 
workings. Shepherd has come up with the term 
'neurogastronomy' to link the disciplines of food 
science, neurology, psychology, and anthropology 


with the savory elements of eating, one of the most 
enjoyed of human experiences. 

In many ways, he is discovering that smell is 
rather like face recognition, The visual system 
detects patterns of light and dark and, building on 
experience, the brain creates a spatial map. It uses 
this to interpret the interrelationship of the patterns 
and draw conclusions that allow us to identify people 
and places. In the same way, we use patterns and 
ratios to detect both new and familiar flavors. As 
we eat, specialised receptors in the back of the nose 
detect the air molecules in our meals. From signals 
sent by the receptors, the brain understands smells 
as complex spatial patterns. Using these, as well as 
input from the other senses, it constructs the idea of 
specific flavors. 

This ability to appreciate specific aromas turns out to 
be central to the pleasure we get from food, much as 
our ability to recognise individuals is central to the 
pleasures of social life. The process is so embedded 
in our brains that our sense of smell is critical to our 
enjoyment of life at large. Recent studies show that 
people who lose the ability to smell become socially 
insecure, and their overall level of happiness plummets. 

Working out the role of smell in flavor interests food 
scientists, psychologists, and cooks alike. The relatively 
new discipline of molecular gastronomy, especially, 
relies on understanding the mechanics of aroma 
to manipulate flavor for maximum impact. In this 
discipline, chefs use their knowledge of the chemical 
changes that take place during cooking to produce 
eating pleasures that go beyond the 'ordinary:

Test 2 


However, whereas molecular gastronomy is 
concerned primarily with the food or 'smell' 
molecules, neurogastronomy is more focused on the 
receptor molecules and the brain's spatial images for 
smell, Smell stimuli form what Shepherd terms 'odor 
objects', stored as memories, and these have a direct 
link with our emotions, The brain creates images of 
unfamiliar smells by relating them to other more 
familiar smells. Go back in history and this was part 
of our survival repertoire; like most animals, we drew 
on our sense of smell, when visual information was 
scarce, to single out prey. 

Thus the brain’s flavor-recognition system is a highly 
complex perceptual mechanism that puts all five 
senses to work in various combinations. Visual and 
sound cues contribute, such as crunching, as does 


touch, including the texture and feel of food on 
our lips and in our mouths. Then there are the taste 
receptors, and finally, the smell, activated when we 
inhale. The engagement of our emotions can be 
readily illustrated when we picture some of the wide- 
ranging facial expressions that are elicited by various 
foods - many of them hard-wired into our brains 
at birth. Consider the response to the sharpness 
of a lemon and compare that with the face that is 
welcoming the smooth wonder of chocolate. 

The flavor-sensing system, ever receptive to new 
combinations, helps to keep our brains active and 
flexible. It also has the power to shape our desires 
and ultimately our bodies, On the horizon we 
have the positive application of neurogastronomy: 
manipulating flavor to curb our appetites.

Dawn of the robots 

They're already here - driving cars, vacuuming carpets and feeding hospital 
patients. Tiny may not be walking, talking , htwum-like sentient beings, but they me 
clever... and a tittle creepy, 

A At first sight it looked like a typical suburban road accident. A Land Rover 
approached a Chevy Tahoe estate car that had stopped at a kerb; the Land 
Rover pulled out and tried to pass the Tahoe just as it started off again. 

There was a crack of fenders and the sound of paintwork being scraped, the 
kind of minor mishap that occurs on roads thousands of times every day. 
Normally drivers get out, gesticulate, exchange insurance details and then 
drive off. But not on this occasion. No one got out of the cars for the simple 
reason that they had no humans inside them; the Tahoe and Land Rover 
were being controlled by computers competing in November's DARPA (the 
D.S. Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency) Urban Challenge. 

B The idea that machines could perform to such standards is startling. 

Driving is a complex task that takes humans a long time to perfect. Yet here, 
each car had its on-board computer loaded with a digital map and route 
plans, and was instructed to negotiate busy roads; differentiate between 
pedestrians and stationary objects; determine whether other vehicles were 
parked or moving off; and handle various parking manoeuvres, which 
robots turn out to be unexpectedly adept at. Even more striking was the 
fact that the collision between the robot Land Rover, built by researchers 
at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and the Tahoe, fitted out bv 
Cornell University Artificial Intelligence (AI) experts, was the only scrape 
in the entire competition. Yet only three years earlier, at DARPA's previous 
driverless car race, every robot competitor - directed to navigate across a 
stretch of open desert - either crashed or seized up before getting near the 
finishing line. 

C It is a remarkable transition that has dear implications for the car of the 
future, More importantly, it demonstrates how robotics sciences and 
Artificial Intelligence have progressed in the past few years - a point 
stressed by Bill Gates, the Microsoft boss who is a convert to these causes, 

' The robotics industry is developing in much the same way the computer 
business did 30 years ago,' he argues. As he points out, electronics 
companies make toys that mimic pets and children with increasing 
sophistication. '1 can envision a future in which robotic devices will become 
a nearly ubiquitous part of our day-to-day lives/ says Gates. 'We may be on 
the verge of a new era, when the PC will get up off the desktop and allow 
us to see, hear, touch and manipulate objects in places where we are not 
physica Hyp resen t.' 


181 






Test 2 


D What is Hit 1 potential for robots and computers in the near future? The fact 
is we still have a way to go before real robots catch up with thei r science 
fiction counterparts/ Gates says. So what are the stumbling blocks? One key 
difficulty is getting robots to know their place This has nothing to do with 
class or etiquette, but concerns the simple issue of positioning. Humans 
orient themselves with other objects in a rcxim very easily. Robots find the 
task almost impossible. 'Even something as simple as telling the difference 
between an open door and a window can be tricky for a robot/ says Gates. 
This has, until recently, reduced robots to fairly static and cumbersome roles. 

E For a long time, researchers tried to get round the problem by attempting to 
re-create the visual processing that goes on in the human cortex. However, 
that challenge has proved to be singularly exacting and complex. So 
scientists have turned to simpler alternatives: 'We have become far more 
pragmatic in our work/ says Nello Cristianini, Professor of Artificial 
Intelligence at the University of Bristol in England and associate editor of 
the journal of Artificial Intelligence Research. 'We are no longer trying to 
re-create human functions. Instead, we are looking for simpler solutions 
with basic electronic sensors, for example.' This approach is exemplified by 
vacuuming robots such as the Electrolux Trilobite. The Trilobite scuttles 
around homes emitting ultrasound signals to create maps of rooms, which 
are remembered for future cleaning, Technology like this is now' changing 
the face of robotics, says philosopher Ron Chrislev, director of the Centre for 
Research in Cognitive Science at the University of Sussex in England. 

F Last year, a new Hong Kong restaurant, Robot Kitchen, opened with a 
couple of sensor-laden humanoid machines directing customers to their 
seats. Each possesses a touch-screen on which orders can be keyed in. The 
robot then returns with the correct dishes. In Japan, University of Tokyo 
researchers recently unveiled a kitchen 'android' that could wash dishes, 
pour tea and make a few limited meals. The ultimate aim is to provide robot 
home helpers for the sick and the elderly, a key concern in a country like 
Japan where 22 per cent of the population is 65 or older. Over US$1 billion a 
year is spent on research into robots that will be able to care for the elderly. 
Robots first learn basic competence - how to move around a house without 
bumping into things. Then we can think about teaching them how to interact 
with humans/ Chrislev said. Machines such as these take researchers into 
the field of socialised robotics: how to make robots act in a way that does not 
scare or offend individuals, 'We need to study how robots should approach 
people, how they should appear. That is going to be a key area for future 
research,' adds Chrislev,

HEADING PASSAGE 3 

You should spend about 20 minutes on Questions 27-40 which are based on Reading 
Passage 3 below. 

It’s your choice! - Or is it really? 

As we move from the industrial age to the information age, societal demands 
on our mental capabilities are no less taxing 


We are constantly required to process a wide range of information to make decisions. 
Sometimes, these decisions are trivial, such as what marmalade to buy. At other times, the 
stakes are higher, such as deciding which symptoms to report to the doctor. However, the 
fact that we are accustomed to processing large amounts of information does not mean 
that we are better at it (Chabris & Simons, 2009). Our sensory and cognitive systems have 
systematic ways of failing of which we are often, perhaps blissfully, unaware, 

Imagine that you are taking a walk in your local city park when a tourist approaches you 
asking for directions, During the conversation, two men carrying a door pass between the 
two of you. If the person asking for directions had changed places with one of the people 
carrying the door, would you notice? Research suggests that you might not. Harvard 
psychologists Simons and Levi {1998) conducted a field study using this exact set-up and 
found that the change in identity went unnoticed by 7 (46.6%) of the 15 participants. 

This phenomenon has been termed 'change blindness'and refers to the difficulty that 
observers have in noticing changes to visual scenes (e.g, the person swap), when the 
changes are accompanied by some other visual disturbance (e.g. the passing of the door). 

Over the past decade, the change blindness phenomenon has been replicated many times. 
Especially noteworthy is an experiment by Davies and Hine (2007) who studied whether 
change blindness affects eyewitness identification. Specifically, participants were presented 
with a video enactment of a burglary. In the video, a man entered a house, walking through 
the different rooms and putting valuables into a knapsack. However, the identity of the 
burglar changed after the first half of the film while the initial burglar was out of sight 
Out of the 80 participants, 49 (61%) did not notice the change of the burglar's identity, 
suggesting that change blindness may have serious implications for criminal proceedings. 

To most of us, it seems bizarre that people could miss such obvious changes while they are 
paying active attention. However, to catch those changes, attention must be targeted to the 
changing feature, in the study described above, participants were likely not to have been 
expecting the change to happen, and so their attention may have been focused on the 
valuables the burglar was stealing, rather than the burglar. 

Drawing from change blindness research, scientists have come to the conclusion that we 
perceive the world in much less detail than previously thought {Johansson, Hall, & Sikstrom, 
2003), Rather than monitoring all of the visual details that surround us, we seem to focus our 
attention only on those features that are currently meaningful or important, ignoring those 
that are irrelevant to our current needs and goals. Thus at any given time, our representation 
of the world surrounding us is crude and incomplete, making it possible for changes or 
manipulations to go undetected (Chabris & Simons, 2010) 


184 




Reading 


Given the difficulty people have in noticing changes to visual stimuli, one may wonder 
what would happen if these changes concerned the decisions people make.To examine 
choice blindness, Hall and colleagues (2010) invited supermarket customers to sample 
two different kinds of jams and teas. After participants had tasted or smelled both 
samples, they indicated which one they preferred. Subsequently, they were purportedly 
given another sample of their preferred choice. On half of the trials, however, these 
were samples of the non-chosen jam or tea. As expected, only about one-third of the 
participants detected this manipulation, Based on these findings, Hall and colleagues 
proposed that choice blindness is a phenomenon that occurs not only for choices 
involving visual material, but also for choices involving gustatory and olfactory 
information. 

Recently, the phenomenon has also been replicated for choices involving auditory stimuli 
(Sauerland, Sagana, & Otgaar, 2012). Specifically, participants had to listen to three pairs 
of voices and decide for each pair which voice they found more sympathetic or more 
criminal,The voice was then presented again; however, the outcome was manipulated 
for the second voice pair and participants were presented with the non-chosen voice. 
Replicating the findings by Hall and colleagues, only 29% of the participants detected this 
change. 

Merckelbach, Jelicic, and Pieters (2011) investigated choice blindness for intensity ratings 
of one's own psychological symptoms. Their participants had to rate the frequency with 
which they experienced 90 common symptoms (e.g. anxiety, lack of concentration, stress, 
headaches etc.) on a 5-point scale. Prior to a follow-up interview, the researchers inflated 
ratings for two symptoms by two points. For example, when participants had rated their 
feelings of shyness, as 2 (i.e, occasionally), it was changed to 4 (i.e. all the time). This time, 
more than half (57%) of the 28 participants were blind to the symptom rating escalation 
and accepted it as their own symptom intensity rating.This demonstrates that blindness is 
not limited to recent preference selections, but can also occur for intensity and frequency. 

Together, these studies suggest that choice blindness can occur in a wide variety of 
situations and can have serious implications for medical and judicial outcomes. Future 
research is needed to determine how, in those situations, choice blindness can be avoided.

SECRETS 



SWARM 


Insects, binds and fish tend to be the creatures that humans feel furthest from. Unlike many 
mammals they do not engage in human-like behaviour. The way they swarm or flock together 
does not usually get good press coverage either: marching like w orker ants might be a 
common simile for city commuters, but it’s a damning, not positive, image. Yet a new school 
of scientific theory suggests that these swarms might have a lot to leach us. 

American author Peter Miller explains, 'l used to think that individual ants knew where they 
were going, and what they were supposed to do when they got there. 13m Deborah Gordon, a 
biologist ai Stanford University, show ed me that nothing an ant does makes any sense except 
in terms of the whole colony. Which makes you wander if. as indr. iduals, we don’t serve a 
similar function for the com pantos where we work or the communities where we live,’ Ants 
are not intelligent by themselves. Yet as a colony, they make wise decisions. And as Gordon 
discovered during her research, there’s no one ant making decisions or giving orders. 

Take food collecting, for example. No ant decides, ‘There’s lots of food around today; lots 
of ants should go out to collect it," Instead, some forager ants go out, and as soon as they 
find food, they pick it up and come back to the nest. At the entrance, they biush past reserve 
foragers, sending a ‘go out' signal. The faster the foragers come back, the more food there 
is and die faster other foragers go out, until gradual ly the amount of food being brought 
back diminishes. An organic calculation has been made to answer the question, ‘ How many 
foragers does the colony need today?' And i f something goes wrong a hungry lizard 
prowling around for an ant snack, f or instance then a rush of ants returning without food 
sends waiting reserves a 'Don’t go out' signal. 

Hut could such decentralised control work in a human organisation? Miller visited a Texas 
gas company that has success fully applied formulas based on ant colony behaviour to 
‘optimise its factories and route its trucks’. He explains, ‘If ant colonies had worked out a 
reliable way to identify the best routes between their nest and food sources, the company 
managers figured, why not take advantage of that know ledge?’ So they came up with a 
computer model, based on the self-organising principles of an ant colony. Data is fed into 
(he model about deliveries needing to be made the next day, as well as things like weather 
conditions, and it produces a simulation determining the best route for the delivery lorries 
to take. 

Miller explains that he first really understood the impact that swarm behaviour could 
have on humans w lien he read a study of honeybees by Tom Seeley, a biologist at Cornell 
University. The honeybees choose as a group which new nest to move to. First, scouts fly off 
to investigate multiple sites. When they return they do a ‘waggle dance* lor their spot, and 
other scouts will then fly olT and investigate it. Many bees go out. but none tries to compare 
all sites. Each reports back on just one. The more they liked their nest, the more vigorous and

lengthy their waggle dance and the more bees w ill choose to v isit it. Gradually the volume 
of bees builds up towards one site; it’s a system that ensures that support for the best site 
snowballs and the decision is made in the most democratic way. 

Humans, too, can make clever decisions through diversity of knowledge and a little friendly 
competition. The best example of shared decision-making that 1 witnessed during my 
research was a tow n meeting I attended in Vermont, where citizens met face-to-face to debate 
their annual budget.'explains Miller. ‘For group decision-making to work well, you need a 
way 10 sort through the various options they propose; and you need a mechanism to narrow 
down these options.' Citizens in Vermont control their municipal affairs by putting forward 
proposals, or hacking up others" suggestions, until a consensus is reached through a vote. As 
with the bees, the broad sampling of options before a decision is made will usually result in 
a compromise acceptable to all. The ‘wisdom of the crowd’ makes clever decisions for the 
good of (he group-and leaves citizens feeling represented and respected. 

The Internet is also an area where we arc increasingly exhibiting swarm behav iour, without 
any physical contact. Miller compares a wiki website, for example, to a termite mound- 
indirect collaboration is the key principle behind in format ion-sharing web sites, just as it 
underlies the complex constructions that termites build. Termites do not have an architect’s 
blueprint or a grand construction scheme. They simply sense changes in their environment, 
as for example when the mound’s wall has been damaged, altering the circulation of air. They 
go to the site of the change and drop a grain of sot). When the next termite finds that grain, 
they drop theirs too. Slowly, without any kind ofdirecl decision-making, a new wall is built. 

A termite mound, in this way, is rather like a wiki website. Rather than meeting up and talking 
about what w e w ant to post online, we just add to what someone - maybe a stranger on the 
Other side of the world - already wrote. This indirect knowledge and skill-sharing is now 
finding its way into the corridors of power

High Speed, High Rise 

A Chinese entrepreneur he s figured our a way to manufacture 30-story , earthquake- 
proof skyscrapers that snap together in just 75 days, 

A Zhang Yue is founder and chairman of Broad Sustainable Building (otherwise known 
as 'Broad! who, on 1 January, 2012, released a time-lapse video of its 30-story 
achievement. It shows construction workers buzzing around like gnats while a dock 
in the corner of the screen marks the time. In just 360 hours, a 100-metre-tall tower 
called the T30 rises from an empty site to overlook Hunan's Xiang River. At the end 
of the video, the camera spirals around the building overhead as the Broad logo 
appears on the screen: a lowercase b that wraps around itself in an imitation of the 
@ symbol- The company is in the process of franchising its technology to partners in 
India, Brazil, and Russia, What it is selling is the world's first standardized skyscraper 
and with it, Zhang aims to turn Broad into the McDonald's of the sustainable 
building industry. When asked why he decided to start a construction company, 
Zhang replies, 'It's not a construction company. It's a structural revolution.' 

B So far. Broad has built 16 structures in China, plus another in Cancun. They are 
fabricated at two factories in Hunan, roughly an hour's drive from Broad Town, 
the sprawling headquarters, The floors and ceilings of the skyscrapers are built in 
sections, each measuring 15.6 by 3.9 meters with a depth of 45 centimeters. Pipes 
and ducts for electricity, water and waste are threaded through each floor module 
while it is still in the factory. The client's choice of flooring is also pre-installed on 
top. Standardized truckloads carry two modules each to the site with the necessary 
columns, bolts and tools to connect them stacked on top of each other. Once 
they arrive at the location, each section is lifted by crane directly to the top of the 
building, which is assembled like toy Lego bricks. Workers use the materials on 
the module to quickly connect the pipes and wires. The unique column design has 
diagonal bracing at each end and tabs that bolt into the floors above and below. In 
the final step, heavily insulated exterior walls and windows are slotted in by crane. 
The result is far from pretty but the method is surprisingly safe - and 
phenomenally fast. 

C Zhang attributes his success to his creativity and to his outsider perspective on 
technology. He started out as an art student in the 1980s, but in 1988, Zhang 
left the art world to found Broad. The company started out as a maker of non- 
pressurized boilers. His senior vice-president, Juliet Jiang, says, 'He made his 
fortune on boifers. He could have kept doing this business, but he saw the need 
for nonelectric air-conditioning.’ Towards the end of the decade, China's economy 
was expanding past the capacity of the nation's electricity grid, she explains. Power 
shortages were becoming a serious obstacle to growth. Large air-conditioning (AC) 
units fueled by natural gas could help companies ease their electricity load, reduce 
overheads, and enjoy more reliable climate control Into the bargain. Today, Broad 
has units operating in more than 70 countries, in some of the largest buildings and 
airports on the planet. 






Test 3 


D For two decades, Zhang's AC business boomed. But a couple of events conspired 
to change his course. The first was that Zhang became an environmentalist. The 
second was the earthquake that hit China's Sichuan Province in 2008, causing the 
collapse of poorly constructed buildings. Initially, he says, he tried to convince 
developers to refit existing buildings to make them both more stable and more 
sustainable, but he had little success. So Zhang drafted his own engineers and 
started researching how to build cheap, environmentally friendly structures that 
could also withstand an earthquake. Within six months of starting his research, 
Zhang had given up on traditional methods. He was frustrated by the cost of hiring 
designers and specialists for each new structure. The best way to cut costs, he 
decided, was to take building to the factory. But to create a factory-built skyscraper, 
Broad had to abandon the principles by which skyscrapers are typically designed. 
The whole load-bearing structure had to be different To reduce the overall weight 
of the building, it used less concrete in the floors; that in turn enabled it to cut 
down on structural steel. 

E Around the world, prefabricated and modular buildings are gaining in popularity. 
But modular and prefabricated buildings elsewhere are, for the most part, low- 
rise. Broad is alone in applying these methods to skyscrapers. For Zhang, the 
environmental savings alone justify the effort. According to Broad's numbers, a 
traditional high-rise will produce about 3,000 tons of construction waste, while a 
Broad building will produce only 25 tons. Traditional buildings also require 5,000 
tons of water onsite to build, while Broad buildings use none. The building process 
is also less dangerous, Elevator systems - the base, rails, and machine room - can 
be installed at the factory, eliminating the risk of injury. And instead of shipping 
an elevator car to the site in pieces, Broad orders a finished car and drops it into 
the shaft by crane. In the future, elevator manufacturers are hoping to preinstall 
the doors, completely eliminating any chance that a worker might fall, 'Traditional 
construction is chaotic,' he says. 'We took construction and moved it into the 
factory.' According to Zhang, his buildings will help solve the many problems of the 
construction industry and what's more, they will be quicker and cheaper to build.

READING PASSAGE 3 

you should spend about 20 minutes on Questions 27-40, which are based on Reading 
Passage 3 below. 


When conversations flow 


We spend a large part of our daily life talking 
with other people and, consequently, we are 
very accustomed to the art of conversing, Rut 
why do we feel com for table in conversations 
that have llow, but get nervous and distressed 
when a conversation is interrupted by 
unexpected silences? To answer this question 
we will first look at some of the effects of 
conversational flow. Then we will explain 
how How can serve different social needs, 

I he positive consequences of conversational 
How show some similarities with the effects 
oi ‘processing fluency’. Research has shown 
that processing fluency - the ease with which 
people process information - influences 
people’s judgments across a broad range of 
social dimensions. For instance, people feel 
that when something is easily processed, 
it is more true or accurate. Moreover, they 
have more confidence in their judgments 
regarding information that came to them 
fluently, and they like things that are easy to 
process more than things that are difficult to 
process. Research indicates that a speaker is 
judged to be more knowledgeable when they 
answer questions instantly; responding with 
distluent speech markers such as ‘uh s or 'uni' 
or simply remaining silent Inr a moment too 
long can destroy that positive image, 

One of the social needs addressed bv 
conversational flow is the human need tor 
synchrony 1 - to he 'in sync’ or in harmony 
with one another. Many studies have shown 
how people at lent pi to synchronize with their 
partners, by coordinating their behavior. This 
interpersonal coordination underlies a wide 
array of human activities, ranging from more 
complicated ones like ballroom dancing to 
simply walking or talking with friends. 


In conversations, interpersonal coordination 
is found when people adjust the duration of 
their utterances and their speech rate to one 
another so that they can enable turn-taking 
to occur, without talking over each other or 
experiencing awkward silences. Since people 
are very well-trained in having conversations, 
they' are often able to take turns within 
milliseconds, resulting in a conversational flow 
of smoothly meshed behaviors. A lack of flow 
is characterized by interruptions, simultaneous 
speech or mutual silences. Avoiding these 
features is important for defining and 
maintaining interpersonal relationships. 

The need to belong has been identified as 
one ol the most basic of human motivations 
and plays a role in many human behaviors. 
That conversational flow is related to 
belonging may be most easily illustrated 
by the consequences of flow disruptions. 

What happens when the positive experience 
of flow is disrupted by, for instance, a brief 
silence? We all know that silences can be 
pretty awkward, and research shows that 
even short disruptions in conversational 
flow can lead to a sharp rise in distress levels. 

In movies, silences are often used to signal 
non-compliance or confrontation (Piazza, 
2006). Some researchers even argue thai 
'silencing someone’ is one of the most serious 
forms of exclusion. Group membership is of 
elementary importance to our wellbeing and 
because humans are very sensitive to signals 
of exclusion, a silence is generally taken as a 
sign of rejection. In this way, a lack of flow in a 
conversation may signal that our relationship 
is not as solid as we thought it was. 

Another aspect of synchrony is that people 
often try to validate their opinions to those 


202 




Reading 


of others. Thai is, people like to see others as 
having similar ideas or worldviews as they 
have themselves, because this informs people 
that they are correct and their worldviews 
are justified. One way in which people can 
justify their worldviews is by assuming that, 
as long as their conversations run smoothly, 
their interaction partners probably agree with 
them. This idea was tested by researchers 
using video observations. Participants 
imagined being one out of three people 
in a video clip who had either a tluent 
conversation or a conversation in which 
(low was disrupted by a brie) silence. Except 
for the silence, the videos were identical 
After watching the video, participants were 
asked to what extent the people in the 
video agreed with each other. Participants 
who watched the fluent conversation rated 
agreement to be higher than participants 
watching the conversation that was disrupted 
by a silence, even though participants were 
not consciously aware of the disruption, it 
appears that the subjective feeling of being 
out of sync informs people of possible 
disagreements, regardless of the content of 
the conversation. 


Because people are generally so well- 
trained in having smooth conversations, 
any disruption of this flow indicates that 
something is wrong, either interperson ally or 
within the group as a whole. Consequently, 
people who do not talk very easily may 
be incorrectly understood as being less 
agreeable than those who have no difficulty 
keeping up a conversation. On a societal 
level one could even imagine that a lack 
of conversational How may hamper the 
integrat ion of immigrants who have not 
completely mastered the language of their 
new country yet. In a similar sense, the ever- 
increasing number of online conversations 
may be disrupted by misinterpretations and 
anxiety that are produced by insuperable 
delays in the internet connection. Keeping 
in mind the effects of conversational flow 
tor feelings of belonging and validation 
may help one to be prepared to avoid such 
misunderstandings in future conversations.

Synchrony 

There is a human desire to co-ordinate 33.in an effort to be in harmony' This 

co-ordination can be seen in conversations when speakers alter the speed and extent of 

their Speech in order to facilitate 34.. This is often achieved within milliseconds: 

only tiny pauses take place when a conversation flows: when it doesn't, there are 
35 ....and silences, or peopfe talk at the same time. 


Our desire to 36. is also an important element of conversation flow. According 

to research, our 37 .increase even if silences are brief. Humans have a basic 


need to be part of a group, and they experience a sense of 38 .if silences 

exclude them. 

People also attempt to co-ordinate their opinions in conversation. In an experiment, 
participants'judgement of the overall 39 among speakers was tested using 

videos of a fluent and a slightly disrupted conversation. The results showed that the 

40 .of the speakers' discussion was less important than the perceived 

synchrony of the speakers.

South Pole Adventurer 

In the race to the South Pole, there was a Japanese team attempting to be first, 

led by heroic explorer Nobu Shirase 


FOR a few weeks in January 1912, Antarctica 
was full of explorers. Norwegian Roald 
Amundsen had reached the South Pole on 
14 December and was speeding back to the 
coast. On 17 January, Robert Scott and the 
men of the British Antarctic expedition had 
arrived at the pole to find they had been beaten 
to it. Just then, a third man arrived: Japanese 
explorer Nobu Shirase. However, his part in 
one of the greatest adventure stories of the 
20th century is hardly known outside his own 
country, even by fellow explorers. Yet as Scott 
was nearing the pole and with the rest of the 
world still unaware of Amundsen’s triumph, 
Shirase and his team sailed into Antarctica's 
Bay of Whales in the smallest ship ever to try 
its luck in these dangerous waters. 

Since boyhood Shirase had dreamed of 
becoming a polar explorer. Like Amundsen, 
he initially set his sights on the North Pole. 

But after the American Robert Peary claimed 
to have reached it in 1909, both men hastily 
altered their plans, Instead they would aim for 
the last big prize: the South Pole. In January 
1910, Shirase put his plans before Japanese 
government officials, promising to raise the 
flag at the South Pole within three years. For 
many of them, the question wasn't could he 
do it but why would it be worth doing? 15 
years earlier the International Geographical 
Congress had said that as the last unknown 
continent the Antarctic offered the chance to 
add to knowledge in almost every branch of 
science. So, like the British, Shirase presented 
his expedition as a search for knowledge: he 


would bring back, fossils, make meteorological 
measurements and explore unknown parts of 
the continent. 

The response from the government was 
cool, however, and Shirase struggled to 
raise funds. Fortunately, a few months later, 
Japan’s former prime minister Shigenobu 
Okuma came to Shirase’s rescue, With 
Qkuma's backing, Shirase got together just 
enough money to buy and equip a small ship. 
He eventually acquired a scientist, too, called 
Terutaro Takeda. At the end of November 
1910, his ship the Kainan Maru finally left 
Tokyo with 27 men and 28 Siberian dogs on 
board. Before leaving, Shirase confidently 
outlined his plans to the media. He would sail 
to New Zealand, then reach Antarctica in 
February, during the southern summer, and 
then proceed to the pole the following spring. 
This was not to be. however. Bad weather 
delayed the expedition and they didn’t reach 
New Zealand until B February; Amundsen and 
Scott had already been in Antarctica for a 
month, preparing for winter. 

In New Zealand local reporters were 
astonished: the ship was half the size of 
Amundsen's ship. True, it was reinforced with 
iron plate and extra wood, but the ship had 
only the feeblest engine to help force its way 
through ice, Few doubted Shirase’s courage, 
but most reckoned the expedition to be ill- 
prepared as the Japanese had only lightweight 
sledges for transport across the ice, made of 
bamboo and wood.

Test 4 


But Shirase's biggest challenge was time, 
Antarctica is only accessible by sea for a few 
weeks in summer and expeditions usually aimed 
to arrive in January or February 'Even with 
their determination and daring, our Japanese 
friends are running it rather fine,' wrote local 
reporters. Nevertheless, on 11 February 
the Kainan Marti left New Zealand and sailed 
straight into the worst weather the captain had 
ever seen. Then, on 6 March, they approached 
the coastline of Antarctica's Ross Sea, looking 
for a place to land. The ice began to close in, 
threatening to trap them for the winter, an 
experience no one was likely to survive, With a 
remarkable piece of seamanship, the captain 
steered the ship out of the ice end turned 
north. They would have to wait out the winter in 
a warmer climate, 

A year later than planned, Shirase and six men 
finally reached Antarctica, Catching up with 
Scott or Amundsen was out of the question and 
he had said he would stick to science this time. 
Yet Shirase still felt the pull of the pole and 
eventually decided he would head southward 
to experience the thrills and hardships of polar 
exploration he had always dreamed of. With 
provisions for 20 days, he and four men would 
see how far they could get, 


Shirase set off on 20 January 1912 with 
Take da and two dog handlers, leaving two 
men at the edge of the ice shelf to make 
meteorological measurements. For a week 
they struggled through one blizzard after 
another, holing up in their tents during the 
worst of the weather. The temperature fell 
to -25°C, and frostbite claimed some of the 
dogs. On 26 January, Shirase estimated 
there were enough provisions to continue for 
two more days. Two days later, he announced 
it was time to turn back. Takeda calculated 
they had reached 80° 5 south and had 
travelled 250 kilometres. The men hoisted 
the Japanese flag, 

On 3 February, all the men were heading 
home. The ship reached Tokyo in June 1912 
- and Shirase was greeted like a hero despite 
the fact that he never reached the pole. Nor 
did he contribute much to science - but then 
nor did Amundsen, whose only interest was in 
being first to the pole, Yet Shirase's expedition 
was heroic, They travelled beyond 80* south, 
one of only four teams to have gone so far 
south at the time. Furthermore, they did it all 
without the advantages of the other teams 
and with no previous experience.

READING PASSAGE 2 

You should spend about 20 minutes on Questions 14-26. which are based on 
Reading Passage 2 below. 

The rise of (he agribois 

The use of robots (turf automation in the farming industry 


The next lime you stand al the supermarket 
checkout, spare a f bought for the farmers who 
helped fill your shopping basket as life is hard 
for them right now. This, in turn, inevitably 
means bigger grocery bills for consumers, and 
greater hardship for the millions in countries 
where food shortages are a matter of life and 
death. Worse, studies suggest that the world 
will need twice as much food by 2050. Yet 
while farmers must squeeze more out of the 
land, they must also address the necessity of 
reducing their impact on the soil, waterways 
and atmosphere. All this means rethinking how 
agriculture is practiced, and taking automation 
to a whole new level. On the new model farms 
of the fin tire, precision w ill be key. Why dose a 
whole field with chemicals if you can spray only 
w here they are needed? Each plant could get 
exactly the right amount of everything, no more 
or less, an approach that could slash chemical 
use and improve yields in one move. But this 
is easier said than done- the largest farms in 
Europe and the U.S. can cover thousands of 
ac res. That's why automation is key to precision 
fanning Specifically, say agricultural engineers, 
precision fanning needs robot farmers. 

One day, we might see fields with 'agribots* 
(agricultural robots) that can identify individual 
seedlings and encourage them along with drops 
of fertilizer. Other machines would distinguish 
problem w eeds from crops and eliminate them 
with shots from high-power lasers or a microdot 
of pesticide. These machines will also be able 
to identify and harvest all kinds of vegetables. 
More than a century of mec haniz ation has 
already turned farming into an industrial-scale 
activity in much of the world, with farms that 
grow cereals being the most heavily automated. 


But a variety of other crops, including oranges 
and tomatoes destined to become processed 
foods, are also picked mechanically, albeit 
to a slightly lesser extent. Yet the next wave 
of autonomous farm machinery is already at 
work. You probably haven't even noticed, for 
these robots are disguised as tractors. Many are 
self-steering, use GPS to cross a field, and can 
even ‘talk’ to their implements - a plough or 
sprayer, for example. And the implements can 
talk back, telling the tractor that it’s going too 
fast or needs to move to the left. This kind of 
communication is also being developed in other 
farm vehicles. A new system allows a combine 
harvester, say, to send a call over to a tractor- 
trailer so the driver can unload the grain as and 
when necessary. 

However, when fully autonomous systems take 
to the field, they’ll look nothing like tractors. 
With their enormous size and weight, today’s 
farm machines have significant downsides: 
they compact the soil, reducing porosity and 
killing beneficial life, meaning crops don’t grow 
SO well. Simon Blackmore, who researches 
agricultural technology al Harper Adams 
University College in England believes that 
fleets of lightweight autonomous robots have 
the potential to solve this problem and that 
replacing brute force with precision is key. ‘A 
seed only needs one cubic centimeter of soil to 
grow, If w r e cultivate just that wc only put tiny 
amounts of energy in and the plants Still grow r 
nicely’ There is another reason why automation 
may be the way forward according to Eldert van 
Uenten, a robotics researcher at Wageningen 
University in the Netherlands. 'While the 
population is growing and needs to be fed, a 
rapidly shrinking number of people are willing

Reading 


to work in agriculture/ lie points out Other 
researchers such as Linda Calvin, an economist 
at the U.S. Department of Agriculture, and 
Philip Martin at the University of California, 
Davis, have studied trends in mechanization to 
predict how US farms might fare. Calvin and 
Martin have observed how rising employment 
costs have led to the adoption of labour-saving 
farm technology in the past, citing the raisin 
industry as an example. In 2000, a bumper 
harvest crashed prices and, with profits 
squeezed, farmers looked for a solution. With 
labour one of their biggest costs - 12 percent of 
production expenses on U.S. farms, on average 
- they started using a mechanical harvester 
adapted from a machine used by wine makers. 
By 2007, almost half of California’s raisins were 
mechanically harvested and a labour force once 
numbering 50,000 had shrunk to 30,000. 

As well as having an impact on the job market, 
the widespread adoption of agribots might bring 
changes at the supermarket. Lewis Holloway, 


who studies agriculture at the University of 
Hull, UK, says that robotic milking is likely to 
influence the genetics of dairy herds as fa inters 
opt for ‘robot-friendly’ cows, with udder 
shape, and even attitudes, suited to automated 
milking. Similarly, he says, it’s conceivable that 
agribots could influence what Fruit or vegetable 
varieties gel to the shops, since farmers may 
prefer to grow' those with, say, leaf shapes that 
are easier for their robots to discriminate from 
weeds. Almost inevitably, these machines will 
eventually alter the landscape, too. Tim real 
tipping point for robot agriculture will come 
when farms are being designed with agribots 
in mind, says Salah Sukkarieh, a robotics 
researcher at the Australian Center for Field 
Robotics, Sydney. This could mean a return to 
smaller fields, with crops planted in grids rather 
than rows and fruit trees pruned into two- 
dimensional shapes to make harvesting easier. 
This alien terrain tended by robots i-S still a 
while away, he says but it will happen. 4

Homer's Literary Legacy 

Why was the work of Homer, famous author of ancient Greece, so fuff of cliches? 

A Until the last tick of history's clock, cultural transmission meant oral transmission and 
poetry, passed from mouth to ear, was the principal medium of moving information across 
space and from one generation to the next. Oral poetry was not simply a way of telling 
lovely or important stories, or of flexing the Imagination, It was, argues the classicist Eric 
Havelock, a "massive repository of useful knowledge, a Sort of encyclopedia of ethics, 
politics, history and technology which the effective citizen was required to learn as the 
core of his educational equipment". The great oral works transmitted a shared cultural 
heritage, held in common not on bookshelves, but in brains. In India, an entire class of 
priests was charged with memorizing the Vedas with perfect fidelity. In pre-lslamic Arabia, 
people known as Rawis were often attached to poets as official memorizers.The Buddha's 
teachings were passed down in an unbroken chain of oral tradition for four centuries until 
they were committed to writing in Sri Lanka in the first century ESC 

6 The most famous of the Western tradition's oral works, and the first to have been 
systematically studied, were Homer's Odyssey and Iliad .These two poems - possibly the 
first to have been written down in the Greek alphabet - had long been held up as literary 
archetypes. However, even as they were celebrated as the models to which all literature 
should aspire, Homer's masterworks had also long been the source of scholarly unease. 

The earliest modern critics sensed that they were somehow qualitatively different from 
everything that came after - even a little strange. For one thing, both poems were oddly 
repetitive in the way they referred to characters. Odysseus was always ‘'ciever Odysseus". 
Dawn was a I ways "rosy-fingered" Why would someone write that? Sometimes the epithets 
seemed completely off-key. Why call the murderer of Agamemnon "blameless Aegisthos"? 
Why refer to "swift-footed Achilles" even when he was sitting down? Or to "laughing 
Aphrodite" even when she was in tears? In terms of both structure and theme, the Odyssey 
and Iliad were also oddly formulaic, to the point of predictability, The same narrative units - 
gathering armies, heroic shields, challenges between rivals - pop up again and again, only 
with different characters and different circumstances, in the context of such finely spun, 
deliberate masterpieces, these quirks 1 seemed hard to explain. 

C At the heart of the unease about these earliest works of literature were two fundamental 
questions: first, how could Greek literature have been bom ex nihilo* with two 
masterpieces? Surely a few less perfect stories must have come before, and yet these 
two were among the first on record. And second, who exactly was their author? Or was it 
authors? There were no historical records of Homer, and no trustworthy biography of the 
man exists beyond a few self-referential hints embedded in the texts themselves, 

D Jean-Jacq ues Rousseau was one of the first modern critics to suggest that Homer might 
not have been an author in the contemporary sense of a single person who sat down 
and wrote a story and then published it for others to read. In his 1781 Essay on the Origin 
of Languages, the Swiss philosopher suggested that the Odyssey and Iliad might have 


220 




Reading 


been "written only in men's memories. Somewhat later they were laboriously collected in 
writing" -though that was about as far as his enquiry into the matter went 

E In 1795, the German philologist Friedrich August Wolf argued for the first time that not 
only were Homer’s works not written down by Homer, but they weren't even by Homer. 
They were, rather, a loose collection of songs transmitted by generations of Greek bards*, 
and only redacted* in their present form at some later date, in 1920, an eighteen-year-old 
scholar named Milman Parry took up the question of Homeric authorship as his Master's 
thesis at the University of California, Berkeley. He suggested that the reason Homer's 
epics seemed unlike other literature was because they were unlike other literature. Parry 
had discovered what Wood and Woif had missed: the evidence that the poems had been 
transmitted orally was right there in the text itself, All those stylistic quirks, including 
the formulaic and recurring plot elements and the bizarrely repetitive epithets - "clever 
Odysseus" and "gray-eyed Athena " - that had always perplexed readers were actually like 
thumbprints left by a potter: material evidence of how t he poems had been crafted. They 
were mnemonic* aids that helped the bard(s) fit the meter and pattern of the line, and 
remember the essence of the poems. 

F The greatest author of antiquity was actually, Parry argued, just "one of a long tradition of 
oral poets thatcomposed wholly without the aid of writing" Parry realised that if you 
were setting out to create memorable poems, the Odyssey and the Iliad were exactly the 
kind of poems you'd create. It's said that cliches* are the worst sin a writer can commit, 
but to an oral bard, they were essential. The very reason that cliches so easily seep into 
our speech and writing - their insidious memorability - is exactly why they played such 
an important role in oral storytelling. The principles that the oral bards discovered as 
they sharpened their stories through telling and retelling were the same mnemonic 
principles that psychologists rediscovered when they began conducting their first scientific 
experiments on memory around the turn of the twentieth century. Words that rhyme are 
much more memorable than words that don't, and concrete nouns are easier to remember 
than abstract ones. Finding patterns and structure in information is how our brains extract 
meaning from the world, and putting words to music and rhyme is a way of adding extra 
levels of pattern and structure to language.

Trees in trouble 

What is causing the decline of the world s giant forests? 

A Big trees are incredibly important ecologically. For a stan, they sustain countless 
other species. They provide shelter for many animals, and their trunks and branches 
can become gardens, hung with green ferns, orchids and bronieliads, coated with 
mosses and draped with vines, With their tall canopies* basking in the sun, they 
capture vast amounts of energy. This allows them to produce massive crops of fruit, 
flowers and foliage that sustain much of the animal life in the forest, 

B Only a small number of tree species have the genetic capacity to grow really big. The 
mightiest arc native to North America, but big trees grow all over the globe, from the 
tropics to the boreal forests of the high latitudes. To achieve giant stature, a tree needs 
three things: the right place to establish its seedling, good growing conditions and lots 
of time with low adult mortality*. Disrupt any of these, and you can lose your 
biggest trees, 

C In some parts of the world, populations of big trees are dwindling because their 
seedlings cannot survive or grow. In southern India, for instance, an aggressive non¬ 
native shrub, Lantana camam. is invading the floor of many forests, Lantana grows 
so thickly that young trees often fail to take root. With no young trees to replace 
them, it is only a matter of time before most of the big trees disappear. Across much 
of northern Australia, gamba grass from Africa is overrunning native savannah 
woodlands. The grass grows up to four metres tall and burns fiercely, creating super- 
hot fires that cause catastrophic tree mortality. 

D Without the right growing conditions trees cannot get really big, and there is 
some evidence to suggest tree growth could slow in a warmer world, particularly 
in environments that are already warm. Having worked for decades at La Selva 
Biological Station in Puerto Viejo de Sarapiqui. Costa Rica, David and Deborah Clark 
and colleagues have shown that tree growth there declines markedly in warmer 
years, “During the day, their photosynthesis* shuts down when it gets too warm, 
and at night they consume more energy because their metabolic rate increases, much 
as a reptile s would when ii gets warmer," explains David Clark. With less energy 
produced in warmer years and more being consumed just to survive, there is even 
less energy available for growth, 

E The Clarks' hypothesis, if correct, means tropical forests would shrink over time. 

The largest, oldest trees would progressively die off and tend not to be replaced. 
According to the Clarks, this might trigger a destabilisation of the climate; as older 
trees die, forests would release some of their stored carbon into the atmosphere, 
prompting a vicious cycle of further warming, forest shrinkage and carbon emissions. 

F Big trees face threats from elsewhere. The most serious is increasing mortality, 

especially of mature trees. Across much of the planet, forests of slow-growing ancient 
trees have been cleared for human use. In western North America, most have been 
replaced by monocultures of fast-growing conifers Siberia's forests are being logged 
at an incredible rate. Logging in tropical forests is selective but the timber cutters 
usually prioritise the biggest and oldest trees. In the Amazon, my colleagues and l 
found the mortality rale for the biggest trees had tripled in small patches of rainforest 


233 





Te$t5 


surrounded by pa sure land. This happens for two reasons. First, as they grow taller, 
big trees become thicker and less flexible: when winds blow across the surrounding 
cleared land, there is nothing to stop their acceleration. When they hit the trees, the 
impact can snap them in half. Second, rainforest fragments dry out when surrounded 
by dry, hot pastures and the resulting drought can have devastating consequences; 
one four-year study has shown that death rates will double for smaller trees but will 
increase 4,5 limes for bigger trees, 

C. Particular enemies to large trees are insects and disease. Across vast areas of western 
North America, increasingly mild winters are causing massive outbreaks of bark 
beetle. These tiny creatures can kill entire forests as they tunnel their way through 
the inside of trees. Jn both North America and Europe, fungus-causing diseases such 
as Dutch elm disease have killed off millions of stately trees that once gave beauty to 
forests and cities. As a result of human activity, such enemies reach even the remotest 
corners of the world, threatening to make the ancient giants a thing of the past,

READING PASSAGE 2 

You should spend about 20 minutes on Questions 14-26. which are based on 
Reading Passage 2 below. 

Whale Strandings 

Why do whales leave the ocean and become stuck on beaches? 


When the last stranded whale of a group 
eventually dies, the story does not end there, 

A team of researchers begins to investigate, 
collecting skin samples for instance, recording 
anything that could help them answer the crucial 
question: why? Theories abound, some more 
convincing than others. In recent years, navy 
sonar has been accused of causing certain whales 
to strand. It is known that noise pollution from 
offshore industry, shipping and sonar can impair 
underwater communication, but can it really 
drive whales onto our beaches? 

In 19R8, researchers at the Pelagos Cetacean 
Research Institute, a Creek non-profit scientific 
group, linked whale strandings with low- 
frequency sonar tests being carried out by the 
North Atlantic Treaty Organisation {NATO), They 
recorded the stranding of 12 Cuvier’s beaked 
whales over 38,2 kilometres of coastline. NATO 
later admitted it had been testing new sonar 
technology in the same area at the time as the 
strandings had occurred. Mass' whale strandings 
involve four or more animals. Typically they 
all wash ashore together, hut in mass atypical 
strandings (such as the one in Greece), the 
whales don't strand as a group; they are 
scattered over a larger area. 

For humans, hearing a sudden loud noise 
might prove frightening, hut St does not induce 
mass fatality, l or whales, on the other hand, 
there is a theory on how sonar can kill. The 
noise can surprise the animal, causing it to 
swim too quickly to the surface. The result is 
decompression sickness, a hazard human divers 
know all too well. If a diver ascends too quickly 
from a high-pressure underwater environment 
to a lower-pressure one, gases dissolved in 
blood and tissue expand and form bubbles. The 


hubbies block the flow of blood to vital organs, 
and can ultimately lead to death. 

Plausible as this seems, it is still a theory and 
based on our more comprehensive knowledge 
of land-based animals. For this reason, some 
scientists are wary. Whale expert Karen Evans is 
one such scientist. Another is Rosemary Gales, 
a leading expert on whale strandings. She says 
sonar technology cannot always be blamed for 
mass strandings. ‘ It's a case by case situation. 
Whales have been stranding for a very long time - 
pre-sonar. 1 ' And when 00% of all Australian whale 
strandings occur around Tasmania, Gales and her 
team must continue in the search for answers. 

When animals beach next to each other at the 
same lime, the most common cause has nothing 
to do with humans at all, “They’re highly social 
creatures,’ 1 says Gales. "When they mass strand - 
it s complete panic and chaos. If one of the group 
strands and sounds the alarm, others will try to 
swim to its aid, and become stuck themselves" 

Activities such as sonar testing can hint at when 
a stranding may occur, but if conservationists are 
to reduce the number of strandings, or improve 
rescue operations, they need information on 
where strandings are likely to occur as well. 

With this in mind, Ralph James, physicist at the 
University of Western Australia in Perth, thinks 
he may have discovered why whales turn up only 
on some beaches. In 198(i he went to Augusta, 
Western Australia, where more than ! 00 false 
killer whales had beached, "I found out from 
chatting to the locals that whales had been 
stranding there for decades. So I asked myself, 
what is it about this beach?" From this question 
that James pondered over 20 years ago, grew the 
university's Whale Stranding Analysis Project. 


235 






Test 5 


Data has since revealed Thai all mass st ran dings 
around Australia occur on gently sloping sandy 
beaches, some with inclines of less than 0.5%. For 
whale species that depend on an ccholocation 
system to navigate, this kind of beach spells 
disaster. Usually, as they swim, they make 
clicking noises, and the resulting sound waves 
arc reflected in an echo and travel back to them. 
However, These just fade out on shallow beaches, 
so the whale doesn 't hear an echo and it crashes 
onto the shore. 

Bin that is not all. Physics, it appears, can help 
with the when as well as the where. I he ocean 
is full of bubbles. Larger ones rise quickly to 
the surface and disappear, whilst smaller ones 
- called microbubbles - can last for days. It Is 
these that absorb whale ‘clicks! "Rough weather 
generates more bubbles than usual," James adds. 
So, during and after a storm, echoic eating whales 
arc essentially swimming blind. 

Last year was a had one for strand ings in 
Australia. Can we predict if this - or any other 
year - will be any better? Some scientists believe 


we can. They have found trends which could 
be used to forecast bad years' for strand ings in 
the future. In 2005, a survey by Klaus Van sc low 
and Klaus Ricklefs of sperm whale strand Engs in 
the North Sea even found a correlation between 
these and the sunspot cycle, and suggested that 
changes in the Earth's magnetic held might be 
involved, But others are sceptical. "Their study 
was interesting... but the analyses they used were 
Hawed on a number of levels," says Evans. In the 
same year, she co-authored a study on Australian 
st ran dings that uncovered a completely different 
trend. "We analysed data from 1920 to 2002... 
and observed a dear periodicity in the number 
of whales stranded each year that coincides with 
a major climatic cycle" To put it more simply, 
she says, in the years when strong westerly and 
southerly winds bring cool water rich in nutrients 
closer to the Australia coast, there is an increase 
in the number of fish, (he whales follow. 

So what causes mass strand ings? “It's probably 
many different components," says James, And he 
is probably right. But the point is we now know 
what many of those components are.

24 Rosemary Gales has questioned the research techniques used by the Greek 
scientists. 

25 According to Gaies, whales are likely to try to help another whale in trouble-

READING PASSAGE 3 

You should spend about 20 minutes on Questions 27-40 which are based on Reading Passage 3 
below. 


Science in Space 

How will NASA transform the International Space Station from a building site 
into a cutting-edge research laboratory? 


A premier, worlds lass laboratory in low Earth 
orbit,That was how the National Aeronautics 
and Space Administration agency (NASA} sold 
the International Space Station (ISS) to the US 
Congress in 2001.Today no one can doubt the 
agency's technological ambition.The most complex 
engineering project ever attempted has created an 
enormous set of interlinked modules that orbits 
the planet at more than 27,000 kilometres per hour. 
It might be travelling fast but, say critics, as a lab it is 
going nowhere. So far, it has gone through 
SI50 billion. 

So where should its future priorities lie? This 
question was addressed at the recent I st annual 
ISS research and development conference in 
Colorado. Among the presenters was Saiosht Iwase 
of Aichl Medical University in Japan who has spent 
several years developing an experiment that could 
help solve one of the key problems that humans 
will face in space: keeping our bodies healthy in 
weightlessness. One thing that physiologists have 
learned is that without gravity our bodies begin 
to lose strength, leaving astronauts with weakened 
bones, muscles and cardiovascular systems.To 
counter these effects on a long-duration mission 
to, say. Mars, astronauts will almost certainly 
need to create their own artificial gravity. This is 
where Iwase comes in. He leads a team designing 
a centrifuge for humans. In their preliminary 
design, an astronaut is strapped into the seat of a 
machine that resembles an exercise bike. Pedalling 
provides a workout for the astronauts muscles and 
cardiovascular system, but it also causes the seat to 
rotate vertically around a central axis so the rider 
experiences artificial gravity while exercising. 

The centrifuge project highlights the stations 
potential as a research lab. Similar machines have 
flown in space aboard NASA’s shuttles, but they 


couldn’t be tested for long enough to prove whether 
they were effective. It’s been calculated that to 
properly assess a centrifuges impact on human 
physiology,astronauts would have to ride it for 30 
minutes a day for at least two months. The only 
way to test this is in weightlessness, and the only 
time we have to do that is on the space station,' 
says Laurence Young, a space medicine expert at the 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, 

There are certainly plenty of ideas for other 
experiments: but many projects have yet to fly. 

Even if the centrifuge project gets the green light, 
it will have to wait another five years before the 
station s crew can take a spin. Lengthy delays 
like this are one of the key challenges for NASA, 
according to an April 2011 report from the US 
National Academy of Sciences. Its authors said 
they were ’deeply concerned' about the state of 
NASA’s science research, and made a number 
of recommendations, Besides suggesting that 
the agency reduces the time between approving 
experiments and sending them into space.it also 
recommended setting clearer research priorities. 

NASA has already begun to take action, hiring 
management consultants ProOrbis to develop a plan 
to cut through the bureaucracy. And Congress also 
directed NASA to hire an independent organisation, 
the Centre for the Advancement of Science in 
Space (CASIS), to help manage the station’s US lab 
facilities. One of CASISs roles is to convince public 
and private investors that science on the station 
is worth the spend because judged solely by the 
number of papers published, the ISS certainly seems 
poor value: research on the station has generated 
about 3,100 papers since 1998-The Hubble Space 
Telescope, meanwhile, has produced more than 
11,300 papers in just over 20 years, yet it cost less 
than one-tenth of the price of the space station. 


239 






Test 5 


Yet Mark Lfhran, assistant associate administrator 
for the ISS, refutes the criticism that the station 
hasn’t done any useful research. He points to 
progress made on a salmonella vaccine.for example. 
To get the ISS research back on track, CASfS has 
examined more than 100 previous microgravity 
experiments to identify promising research themes. 
From this, rt has opted to focus on life science and 
medical research, and recently called for proposals 
for experiments on muscle wasting, osteoporosis 
and the immune system,The organisation also 
maintains that the ISS should be used to develop 
products with commercial application and to test 
those that are either close to or already on the 
market. Investment from outside organisations is 
vital, says Uhran, and a balance between academic 
and commercial research will help attract this. 

The station needs to attract cutting-edge research, 
yet many scientists seem to have little idea what 
goes on aboard it. Jeanne DiFrancesco at ProOrbis 
conducted more than 200 interviews with people 
from organisations with potential interests in low 
gravity studies. Some were aware of the ISS but 
they didn’t know what’s going on up there, she says. 


Others know there’s science, but they don't know 
what kind. 1 

According to Alan Stern, planetary scientist, the 
biggest public relations boost for the ISS may come 
from the privately funded space flight industry 
Companies like SpoceX could help NASA and its 
partners when it comes to resupplying the ISS, as it 
suggests it can reduce launch costs by two-thirds. 
Virgin Atlantic’s SpoceSfapTwo or 2ero2/n/inity’s high- 
altitude balloon could also boost the space station’s 
fortunes.They might not come close to the ISS s 
orbit, yet Stern believes they will revolutionise the 
way we, the public, see space. Soon everyone will be 
dreaming of interplanetary travel again, he predicts. 
More importantly, scientists are already queuing 
for seats on these low-gravity space-flight services 
so they can collect data during a few minutes of 
weightlessness.This demand for low-cost space 
flight could eventually lead to a service running on a 
moie frequent basis, giving researchers the chance 
to test their ideas before submitting a proposal for 
experiments on the ISS. Getting flight experience 
should help them win a slot on the station,says Stern.

The influence of commercial space flight on the ISS 

According to Alan Stern, private space companies could affect the future of the ISS He 
believes they could change its image: firstly because sending food and equipment there 

would be more 36.if a commerciai craft were used, and secondly, because 

commercial flights might make the whole idea of space exploration seem 37.to

Why Are Finland’s Schools Successful? 

The country's achievements in education have other nations doing their homework 


A At Kirkkojarvi Comprehensive School in Espoo, a suburb west 
of Helsinki, Kani Louhivuori, Ihe school's principal, decided 
to try something extreme by Finnish standards, One of his 
sixth-grade students, a recent immigrant, was falling behind, 
resisting his teacher's best efforts. So he decided to hold 
the boy back a year, Standards in the country have vastly 
improved in reading, math and science literacy over the past 
decade, m large part because its leathers are trusted to do 
whatever it takes to turn young lives around. 'I took Besart on 
that year as my private student.' explains Louhivuori. When 
he was not studying science, geography and math, Besart 
was seated next to Louhivuori's desk, taking books from a tall 
stack, stowfy reading one, then another, then devouring them 
by the dozens. By the end of the year, he had conquered his 
adopted country's vowel-rich language and arrived at the 
realization that he could, in fact. tor. 

B This tale of a single rescued child hints at some of the 
reasons for Finland's amazing record of educaiion success. 
The transformation of its education system began some 
40 years ago but teachers had little idea it had been so 
successful until 2000. In this year, the first results from 
the Programme for International Student Assessment 
(PISA), a standardized test given to 15-year-olds in more 
than 40 global venues, revealed Finnish youth to be the 
best at reading in the world. Three years later, they Jed in 
math, By 2006, Finland was first out of the 57 nations that 
participate in science. In the latest PISA scores, the nation 
came second in science, third in reeding and sixth in math 
among (ready half a million students worldwide. 

c In the United States, govern ment official s have attempted 
to improve standards by introducing marketplace 
competition into public schools. In recent years, a group 
of Wall Street financiers and philanthropists such as Bill 
Gates have put money behind private-sector ideas, such 
as charter schools, which have doubled in number in the 
past decade. President Obama, too. apparently thought 
competition was the answer. One policy invited states to 
compete for federal dollars using tests and other methods 
to measure teachers, a philosophy that would not be 
we come in Finland. 'I think, in tact, teachers would tear 
off their shirts,' said Tfmo Heikkinen. a Helsinki principal 
with 24 yea is of leaching experience. 'If you only 
measure the statistics, you miss the human aspect,' 

D There are no compulsory standardized tests in Finland, 
apart from one exam at the end of students' senior year 


in high school, There is no competition between students, 
schools or regions, Finland's schools are publicly funded. 
The people in the government agencies running them, 
from national officials to local authorises, are educators 
rather than business people or politicians. Every school 
has the same national goals and draws From the same 
pool of university-trained educators. The result is that 
a Finnish child has a good chance of getting the same 
quality education no matter whether he or she lives in a 
rural village or a university town. 

E ft’s almost unheard of for a child to show up hungry to 
school. Finland provides three years of maternity leave 
and subsidized day care to parents, and preschool for 
all five-year-olds, where the emphasis is on socializing, 
lit addition, the slate subsidizes parents, paying them 
around 150 euros per month for every child until he or 
she turns 17, Schools provide food, counseling and taxi 
service if needed. Health care Is even free for students 
taking degree courses, 

F Fin land's schools were not always a wonder. For the first 

half of the twentieth century, only the privileged got a 
quality education, But In 1963, the Finnish Parliament 
made the bold decision lo choose public education as 
the best means of driving the economy forward and out 
of recession. Public schools were organized into one 
system of comprehensive schools for ages 7 through 16. 
Teachers from all over Ihe nation contributed to a national 
curriculum that provided guidelines, not prescriptions, 
lor them to refer to. Besides Finnish and Swedish (the 
country's second official language), children started 
learning a third language (English is a favorite) usually 
beginning at age nine. The equal distribution of equipment 
was next, meaning that all teachers had (heir fair share of 
teaching resources to aid learning. As the comprehensive 
schools improved, so did the upper secondary schools 
(grades 10 through 12). The second critical decision came 
in 1979, when it was required lhat every teacher gain a 
fifth-year Master's degree in theory and practice, paid 
for by the state. From then on, teachers were effectively 
granted equal status wiift dociors and lawyers. Applicants 
began flooding teaching programs, not because the 
salaries were so high but because autonomous decision¬ 
making and respect made the job desirable. And as 
Louhivuori explains. ‘We have our own motivation to 
succeed because we love the work,'

Reading Passage 3 below 


The Swiffer 

For a fascinating tale about creativity, look at a cleaning product called the Suffer and 
how it came about, urges writer Jonah Lehrer. In the story of the Swiffer, he argues, we 
have the key elements in producing breakthrough ideas: frustration, moments of insight 
and sheer hard work. The story starts with a multinational company which had invented 
products for keeping homes spotless, and couldn't come up with better ways to clean 
floors, so it hired designers to watch how people cleaned. Frustrated after hundreds 
of hours of observation, they one day noticed a woman do with a paper towel what 
people do ail the time: wipe something up and throw it away. An idea popped into 
lead designer Harry West's head: the solution to their problem was a floor mop with a 
disposable cleaning surface. Mountains of prototypes and years of teamwork later, they 
unveiled the Swiffer, which quickly became a commercial success. 

Lehrer, the author of imagine, a new book that seeks to explain how creativity works, 
says this study of the imagination started from a desire to understand what happens 
in the brain at the moment of sudden insight 'But the book definitely spiraled out 
of control,' Lehrer says, 'When you talk to creative people, they'll tell you about the 
'eureka'* moment, but when you press them they also talk about the hard work that 
comes afterwards, so I realised I needed to write about that, too. And then I realised I 
couldn't just look at creativity from the perspective of the brain, because it's also about 
the culture and context, about the group and the team and the way we collaborate,' 

When it comes to the mysterious process by which inspiration comes into your head 
as if from nowhere, Lehrer says modern neuroscience has produced a 'first draft' 
explanation of what is happening in the brain. He writes of how burnt-out American 
singer Bob Dylan decided to walk away from his musical career in 1965 and escape to a 
cabin in the woods, only to be overcome by a desire to write. Apparently ‘Like a Rolling 
Stone' suddenly flowed from his pen. 'It’s like a ghost is writing a song,' Dylan has 
reportedly said. It gives you the song and it goes away.' But it's no ghost, according 
to Lehrer, 

Instead, the right hemisphere of the brain is assembling connections between past 
influences and making something entirely new. Neuroscientists have roughly charted 
this process by mapping the brains of people doing word puzzles solved by making 
sense of remotely connect inn information For instance. subjects am given three worrlc 
- such as 'age', 'mile' and 'sand' - and asked to come up with a single word that can 
precede or follow each of them to form a compound word. (It happens to be 'stone'.) 
Using bra in-imaging equipment, researchers discovered that when people get the 
answer in an apparent flash of insight, a small fold of tissue called the anterior superior 
temporal gyrus suddenly lights up just beforehand, This stays silent when the word 
puzzle is solved through careful analysis. Lehrer says that this area of the brain lights up 
only after we've hit the wall on a problem. Then the brain starts hunting through the 
'filing cabinets of the right hemisphere' to make the connections that produce the 
right answer. 




Tesf 6 


Studies have demonstrated it's possible to predict a moment of insight up to eight 
seconds before it arrives. The predictive signal is a steady rhythm of alpha waves 
emanating from the brain's right hemisphere, which are closely associated with relaxing 
activities. 'When our minds are at ease - when those alpha waves are rippling through 
the brain - we're more likely to direct the spotlight of attention towards that stream of 
remote associations emanating from the right hemisphere,' Lehrer writes, ‘In contrast, 
when we are diligently focused, our attention tends to be towards the details of the 
problems we are trying to solve.' In other words, then we are less likely to make those 
vital associations. So, heading out for a walk or lying down are important phases of 
the creative process, and smart companies know this. Some now have a policy of 
encouraging staff to take time out during the day and spend time on things that at first 
glance are unproductive {like playing a PC game), but day-dreaming has been shown 
to be positively correlated with problem-solving. However, to be more imaginative, says 
Lehrer, it's also crucial to collaborate with people from a wide range of backgrounds 
because if colleagues are too socially intimate, creativity is stiffed. 

Creativity, it seems, thrives on serendipity. American entrepreneur Steve Jobs believed 
so, Lehrer describes how at Pixar Animation, Jobs designed the entire workplace to 
maximise the chance of strangers bumping into each other, striking up conversations 
and learning from one another He also points to a study of 766 business graduates 
who had gone on to own their own companies. Those with the greatest diversity of 
acquaintances enjoyed far more success, Lehrer says he has taken all this on board, 
and despite his inherent shyness, when he's sitting next to strangers on a plane or 
at a conference, forces himself to initiate conversations. As for predictions that the 
rise of the internet would make the need for shared working space obsolete, Lehrer 
says research shows the opposite has occurred; when people meet face-to-face, the 
level of creativity increases. This is why the kind of place we live in is so important 
to innovation, According to theoretical physicist Geoffrey West, when corporate 
institutions get bigger, they often become less receptive to change. Cities, however, 
allow our ingenuity to grow by pulling huge numbers of different people together, 
who then exchange ideas, Working from the comfort of our homes may be 
convenient, therefore, but it seems we need the company of others to achieve our 
finest eureka' moments

The Hidden Histories of 
Exploration Exhibition 


it 



We have all hoard tales of lone, heroic explorers, but what about the local 
individuals who guided and protected Kuropoan explorers in many dilT'orenl 
parts of the globe? Or the go-betweens - including inter pi'fliere and traders - 
who translated the needs and demands (^explorers into a language that locals 
could understand? Such questions have received surprisingly little attention in 
standard histories, where European explorers are usually the heroes, sometimes 
the villains. The Hidden Histories of Exploration exhibition at I in tain's Royal 
Geographical Society in London sets out to present an alternative view, in which 
exploration is a fundamentally collective experience of work, involving many 
different people, Many of the most famous examples or explorers so id to have 
been 'lone travellers' - say. Mungo Park or David Livingstone in Africa - wore 
anything hm ‘alone’ on their travels. They depended nit local support of various 
kinds for food, shelter, protection, information, guidance and solace • as well 
as on other resources from elsewhere, 

l ire Royal Geographical Society <KGS) seeks to record this story in its Hidden 
Histories project, using its astonishingly rich collodions,The storage of 
geographical information was one of the main rationales for the foundation 
of lhr IKiS in 1830. and the Society’s collections now contain more than two

Those providing local support and information to explorers were themselves 
often not‘locals'. I’or example, the history of African exploration in the 
nineteenth century is dominated by the use of Zanzibar as a recruiting 
station for porters, soldiers nod guides who would then travel thousands of 
miles :n toss ihe comment. 111 some accounts, tile loading African members 
of expedition parlies - the ‘officers’ or 'foremen' - are Identified, imd their 
portraits published alongside those of European explorers. 


The information provided by locals and intermediaries was of potential 
importance to geographical science. Now was Ibis evidence judged'.' 

The fern ini procedures of scientific evaluation provided one framework. 
Alongside these were more ‘common sense* notions or veracity and reliability, 
religiously-Inspired judgments about the authenticity of testimony, and the 
routine procedures lor cross-checking empirical observations developed in 
many professions. 

Given explorers' need for local information and support, it was in their 
interests to develop effective working partnerships wild knowledgeable 
intermediaries who could act as brokers in their dealings with local 
inhabitants. Many of these people actpiired lar more experience of exploration 
than most Europeans could hope to attain. Some managed large groups of men 
and women, piloted the explorers’ river craft, or undertook mapping work. The 
tradition was continued with the Everest expeditions hi the lOiids end I9.i0s, 
which regularly employed the Tibetan interpreter Karma Paul. In Europe, 
exploration was increasingly thought of as a career; the same might lie said of 
the non’Europeans on whom their expeditions depended.

READING PASSAGE 2

Passage 2 below. 



Attraction 


Evolutionist Charles Darwin first marvelled at flesh-eating plants in the mid-19th century. 

Today biologists, using 21st-century tools to study cells and DNA, are beginning to 

understand hoi* these plants hunt, eat and digest - and hoi* such bizarre adaptations 

arose in the first place 

A The leaves of the Venus flytrap plant are covered in hairs. When an insect brushes 
against them, this triggers a tiny electric charge, which travels down tunnels in the 
leaf and opens up pores in the leaf's cell membranes. Water surges from the cells 
on the inside of the leaf to those on the outside, causing the leaf to rapidly flip 
in shape from convex to concave, like a soft contact lens, As the leaves flip, they 
snap together, trapping the insect in their sharp-toothed jaws. 

B The bladderwort has an equally sophisticated way of setting its underwater trap. 

It pumps water out of tiny bag-like bladders, making a vacuum inside. When 
small creatures swim past, they bend the hairs on the bladder, causing a flap to 
open. The low pressure sucks water in, carrying the animal along with it. In one 
five-hundredth of a second, the door swings shut again. The Drosera sundew, 
meanwhile, has a thick, sweet liquid oozing from its leaves, which first attracts 
insects, then holds them fast before the leaves snap shut. Pitcher plants use yet 
another strategy, growing long tube-shaped leaves to imprison their prey. Raffles' 
pitcher plant, from the jungles of Borneo, produces nectar that both lures insects 
and forms a slick surface on which they can't get a grip. Insects that land on the 
rim of the pitcher slide on the liquid and tumble in. 

C Many carnivorous plants secrete enzymes to penetrate the hard exoskeleton of 
insects so they can absorb nutrients from inside their prey. But the purple pitcher 
plant, which lives in bogs and infertile sandy soils in North America, enlists other 
organisms to process its food, It is home to an intricate food web of mosquito 
larvae, midges and bacteria, many of which can survive only in this unique habitat. 
These animals shred the prey that fall into the pitcher, and the smaller organisms 
feed on the debris. Finally, the plant absorbs the nutrients released. 

D While such plants dearly thrive on being carnivorous, the benefits of eating flesh 
are not the ones you might expect. Carnivorous animals such as ourselves use 
the carbon in protein and the fat in meat to build muscles and store energy. 
Carnivorous plants instead draw nitrogen, phosphorus, and other critical nutrients 
from their prey in order to build light-harvesting enzymes. Eating animals, in other 
words, lets carnivorous plants do what all plants do: carry out photosynthesis, that 
is, grow by harnessing energy directly from the sun. 

E Carnivorous plants are, in fact, very inefficient at converting sunlight into tissue 
This is because of all the energy they expend to make the equipment to catch 
animals - the enzymes, the pumps, and so on, A pitcher or a flytrap cannot carry 
out much photosynthesis because, unlike plants with ordinary leaves, they do not 


275 



Test 7 


have flat solar panels that can grab lots of sunlight. There are, however, some 
special conditions in which the benefits of being carnivorous do outweigh the 
costs. The poor soil of bogs, for example, offers little nitrogen and phosphorus, 
so carnivorous plants enjoy an advantage over plants that obtain these nutrients 
by more conventional means. Bogs are also flooded with sunshine, so even an 
inefficient carnivorous plant can photosynthesise enough light to survive. 

F Evolution has repeatedly made this trade-off. By comparing the DMA of 

carnivorous plants with other species, scientists have found that they evolved 
independently on at least six separate occasions. Some carnivorous plants that 
look nearly identical turn out to be only distantly related. The two kinds of pitcher 
plants - the tropical genus Nepenthes and the North American Sarracenia - have, 
surprisingly, evolved from different ancestors, although both grow deep pitcher- 
shaped leaves and employ the same strategy for capturing prey. 

G In several cases, scientists can see how complex carnivorous plants evolved from 
simpler ones. Venus flytraps, for example, share an ancestor with Portuguese 
sundews, which only catch prey passively, via 'flypaper' glands on their stems. 
They share a more recent ancestor with Drosera sundews, which can also curl 
their leaves over their prey. Venus flytraps appear to have evolved an even more 
elaborate version of this kind of trap, complete with jaw-like leaves. 

H Unfortunately, the adaptations that enable carnivorous plants to thrive in marginal 
habitats also make them exquisitely sensitive. Agricultural run-off and pollution 
from power plants are adding extra nitrogen to many bogs in North America. 
Carnivorous plants are so finely tuned to low levels of nitrogen that this extra 
fertilizer is overloading their systems, and they eventually burn themselves out 
and die. 

1 Humans also threaten carnivorous plants in other ways. The black market trade 
in exotic carnivorous plants is so vigorous now that botanists are keeping the 
location of some rare species a secret. But even if the poaching of carnivorous 
plants can be halted, they will continue to suffer from other assaults. In the 
pine savannah of North Carolina, the increasing suppression of fires is allowing 
other plants to grow too quickly and outcompete the flytraps in their native 
environment. Good news, perhaps, for flies. But a loss for all who, like Darwin, 
delight in the sheer inventiveness of evolution.

Test 1 


WANT TO BE FRIENDS? 

Could the benefits of online social networking he too good to miss out on? 


A For many hundreds of thousands of 
people worldwide, online networking has 
become enmeshed in our daily lives. 

However, it is a decades-old insight from 
a study of traditional social networks 
that best illuminates one of the most 
important aspects of today's online 
networking, In 1973 sociologist Mark 
Granovetter showed how the loose 
acquaintances, or 'weak ties', in our 
social network exert a disproportionate 
influence over our behaviour and choices. 
Granovetter's research showed that a 
significant percentage of people get their 
jobs as a result of recommendations 
or advice provided by a weak tie. Today 
our number of weak-tie contacts hes 
exploded via online social networking, 

'You couldn't maintain all of those weak 
ties on your own,' says Jennifer Golbeck 
of the University of Maryland. 'Online 
sites, such as Facebook, give you a way 
of cataloguing them.’ The result? It’s now 
significantly easier for the schoolfriend 
you haven't seen in years to pass you 
a tip that alters your behaviour, from 
recommendation of a low-cholesterol 
breakfast cereal to a party invite where 
you meet your future wife or husband. 

B The explosion of weak ties could have 
profound consequences for our social 
structures too. according to Judith 
□onath of the Berkman Center for 
Internet and Society at Harvard University. 
'We're already seeing changes,’ she 
says. For example, many people now 
turn to their online social networks ahead 
of sources such as newspapers and 
television for trusted and relevant news or e 
information, What they hear could well be 
inaccurate, but the change is happening 
nonetheless. If these huge ‘supernets’ - 
some of them numbering up to 5,000 
people - continue to thrive and grow. 


they could fundamentally change the way 
we share information and transform our 
notions of relationships. 

C But are these vast networks really that 
relevant to us on a personal level? Robin 
Dunbar, an evolutionary anthropologist 
at the University of Oxford, believes that 
our primate brains place a cap on the 
number of genuine social relationships 
we can actually cope with: roughly 
1! 50, According to Dunbar, online social 
networking appears to be very good 
for 'servicing' relationships, but not for 
establishing them. He argues that our 
evolutionary roots mean we still depend 
heavily on physical and face-to-face 
contact to be able to create ties. 

□ Nonetheless, there is evidence that 

online networking can transform our daily 
interactions. In an experiment at Cornell 
University, psychologist Jeff Hancock 
asked participants to try to encourage 
other participants to like them via instant 
messaging conversation. Beforehand, 
some members of the trial were allowed 
to view the Facebook profile of the person 
they were trying to win over. He found 
that those with Facebook access asked 
questions to which they already knew 
the answers or raised things they had in 
common, and as result were much more 
successful in their social relationships. 
Hancock concluded that people who 
use these sites to keep updated on the 
activities of their acquaintances are 
more likely to be liked in subsequent 
social interactions, 

Online social networking may also have 
tangible effects on our well-being. Nicole 
Ellison of Michigan State University 
found that the frequency of networking 
site use correlates with greater self¬ 
esteem. Support and affirmation from 


280 





Reading 


the weak ties could be the explanation, 
says Ellison, "Asking your close friends 
for help or advice is nothing new, but 
we are seeing a lowering of barriers 
among acquaintances,' she says. People 
are readily sharing personal feelings 
and experiences to a wider circle than 
they might once have done. Sandy 
Pentland at the Massachusetts Institute 
of Technology agrees. The ability to 
broadcast to our social group means 
we need never feel alonehe says. The 
things that befall us are often due to a 
lack of social support. There's more of a 
safety net now.' 

F Henry Holzman, also at MIT, who studies 
the interface between online social 
networking and the real world, points 
out that increased visibility also means 
our various social spheres - family, work, 
friends - are merging, and so we will 
have to prepare for new societal norms, 
Well have to learn how to live a more 
transparent life,' he says. 'We may have 
to give up some ability to show very 
limited glimpses of ourselves to others.’ 


G Another way that online networking 
appears to be changing our social 
Structures is through dominance. In one 
repeated experiment, Michael Kearns of 
the University of Pennsylvania asked 30 
volunteers to quickly reach consensus in 
an online game over a choice between 
two colours. Each person was offered 
a cash reward if they succeeded in 
persuading the group to pick one or 
other colour. All participants could see 
the colour chosen by some of the other 
people, but certain participants had an 
extra advantage: the ability to see more 
of the participants' chosen colours than 
others. Every time Kearns found that 
those who could see the choices of more 
participants (in other words, were better 
connected] persuaded the group to 
pick their colour, even when they had to 
persuade the vast majority to give up their 
financial incentive. While Kearns warns 
that the setting was artificial, he says it’s 
possible that greater persuasive power 
could lie with well-connected individuals in 
the everyday online world too.

The benefits of having 
a business mentor 


Introduction 

If you're starting your own business, you probably need a mentor. This is a business person 
who volunteers to give their time to help somebody else with their work - particularly 
somebody who is new to business, They have a wealth of experience they are willing to share, 
perhaps from setting up and running their own company. The mentor's role is to support, 
develop, stimulate and challenge. However, business mentors won't solve your problems 
for you or tell you what to do; they will talk things over with you, rather than acting as 
consultants. Many people setting up their first business have found that a mentor can have a 
very positive effect on its success. 

Why business mentoring is important 

If you have a gap in your knowledge or experience, then mentoring could work very well for 
you. For example, you may have a great concept for a business but need a bit of assistance to 
turn it into a successful venture. 

A mentor can provide you with a number of benefits, such as: 

* guidance on developing and improving your business 

* help with decisions - particularly difficult ones 

* ideas for new products or services, or for working practices that will Improve your efficiency 

* tips for your business that are gained from practical experience 

* access to a network of contacts with other business people 

A business mentor can also help you to: 

* develop key business skills 

* improve your problem-solving abilities 
■ build confidence 

* work on your personal development 

Face-to-face business mentoring 

If you decide that face-to-face business mentoring is right for you, mentor and mentee should 
decide in advance on the nature of the relationship. 

You will need to agree on the degree of involvement that suits you both. Some mentors and 
mentees work extremely closely, keeping in touch with each other most weeks or even most 
days. In the majority of cases, however, a mentor will provide help every few weeks or months. 
In either case, they might meet, speak on the phone, or exchange emails, 

You should also agree on a level of structure to suit you both, Mentoring can be a very formal 
process with regular meetings which follow a specific agenda and work towards a specific set 
of goals. It can also be quite a casual arrangement, where the mentee calls on the mentor as 
and when problems or questions arise.

A Planning Process for 
Middle-Sized Projects 

Any business project - such as reducing energy costs, or improving efficiency - 

needs to be planned, and time spent planning will save far more time later on. 

The typical stages in this planning process are explained below. 

• Your first task is to spot what needs to be done. Examine your firm's current position, 
perhaps making a formal analysis of its strengths and weaknesses. Then think about 
how you might improve that position: what opportunities are there for achieving this? 

• The next step is to decide precisely what the aim of your plan is. This is best 
expressed in a simple single sentence, to ensure that it is clear and sharp in your 
mind. Doing this helps you to avoid wasting effort on irrelevant side issues, 

• Next you should work out how to do it. It is tempting just to grasp the first idea that 
comes to mind, but it is better to consider a wide range of options: this way, you may 
come up with less obvious but better solutions. 

• Once you have explored the options available to you, the selection of which option to 
use is the next step. If you have the time and resources, you might decide to evaluate 
all options, carrying out some planning, such as costing, for each, Normally you will 
not have this luxury. 

• You already have a broad idea of what your project will consist of. Now is the time to 
work outthe full details, identifying the most efficient and effective method of carrying 
it out, including answering the questions of 'who', ‘what 1 and 'when'. 

• The next stage is to review your plan and decide whether it will work satisfactorily, 
This evaluation enables you to change to another option that might be more 
successful, or to accept that no plan is needed. 

• Once you have finished your plan and decided that it will work satisfactorily, it is time 
for implementation, Your plan will cover how this is to be done. 

• Once you have achieved a plan, you can dose the project. At this point it is often 
worth assessing the project to see whether there are any lessons that you can learn.

Read the text below and answer Questions 28-40 

The Penny Black 

It might not have Looked very impressive* hut the Pen tty Black, now ] 70 years old. was the 
first stamp to be created and it launched the modem postal system in Britain. 

Before 1840 and the arrival of the Penny Black* you had in he rich and patient to use the 
Royal Mail, Delivery was charged according to the miles travelled and the number of sheets 
of paper used: a 2-page letter sent from Edinburgh to London, for example, would have Cost 
2 shillings, or more than £7 in today’s money. And when the top-hat ted letter carrier came 
to deliver it. it was the recipient who had to pay for the postage. Letter writers employed 
various ruses to reduce the cost, doing everything possible to cram more words onto a 
page. Nobody bothered with heavy envelopes: instead, letters would be folded and sealed 
with wax. You then had to find a post office there were no pillar boxes - and hope your 
addressee didn’t live in one of the several rural areas which were not served by the system. If 
you were lucky, your letter would arrive fit could take days) without being read or censored. 

The state of mail had been causing concern throughout the 1830s, but it was Rowland 11 ill, an 
inventor, teacher and social reformer from Kidderminster, who proposed a workable plan lor 
change. Worried that a dysfunctional, costly service would stifle communication just as 
Britain w as in the swing of its second industrial revolution, he believed reform w ould ease 
the distribution of ideas and stimulate trade and business, delivering the same promise as the 
new railways. 

Hill's proposal for the penny post, which meant any letter weighing less than half an ounce 
(14 grams) could be sent anywhere in Britain for about 30p in today’s money, was so radical 
that the Postmaster General. Lord Lichfield, said. 'Of all the wild and visionary schemes 
which 1 ever heard of. It is the most extravagant,' Lord Lichfield spoke for an establishment 
not convinced of the need for poor people to post anything. But merchants and reformers 
backed Hill. Soon the government told him to make his scheme work. And that meant 
inventing a new type of currency. 

Hill quickly settled on ‘a bit of paper covered at tine back with a glutinous wash w hich the user 
might, by applying a Little moisture, attach to the back of a letter’. Stamps would be printed 
in sheets of 240 that could be cut using scissors or a knife. Perforations would not arrive 
until 1854. The idea stuck, and in August 1834 ihe Treasury launched a design competition 
open to 'all artists, men of science and the public in general’. The new stamp would need to 
be resistant to forgery, and so it was a submission by one Mr Che vert on that Hill used as the 
basis for one of the most striking designs in history. Cheverton. who worked as a sculptor 
and an engineer, determined that it port rut of Queen Victoria, engraved for a commemorative 
coin when she was a 15-year-old princess, was detailed enough to make copying difficult, and 
recognisable enough to make fakes easy to spot. The words ‘Postage* and ‘One Penny* were 
added alongside flourishes and ornamental stars. Nobody thought to add the word Britain', as 
it w as assumed that the stamps would solely be pul to domestic use. 

Willi the introduction of the new postal sy stem, the Penny Black w as an instant hit. and 
printers struggled to meet demand. By the end of 1840. more than 160 million letters had 



Heading 


been sent - more than double the previous year, it created more work for the post olTico. 
w hose reform continued with the introduction of red letter boxes, new branches and more 
frequent deliveries, even to the remotest address, but its lasting impact on society was 
more remarkable. 

Hill and his supporters rightly predicted that cheaper post would improve the ‘diffusion of 
knowledge’. Suddenly, someone in Scotland could be reached by someone in London w ithin a 
day or two. And as literacy improved, sections of society that had been disenfranchised found 
a voice. 

Tristram Hunt, an historian, values the 'flourishing of correspondence’ that followed the 
arrival of stamps. ‘While 1 was writing my biography of Friedrich Engels I could read the 
letters he and Marx sent between Manchester and London,’ he says. ‘They wrote to each 
other three times a day. pinging ideas back and forth so that you can almost follow a real¬ 
time correspondence/ 

The penny post also changed the nature of the letter. Weight-saving tricks such as 
cross-w riting began to die out, w hile the arrival of envelopes built confidence among 
correspondents (hat mail would not be stolen or read. And so people wrote more private 
things - politically or commercially sensitive information or love letters. 'In the early days of 
the penny post, there was still concern about theft,' Hunt says. 'Engels would stili send Marx 
money by ripping up five-pound notes and sending (he pieces itt different letters/ Hut the 
probity of the postal system became a great thing and it came to be expected that your mail 
would not be tampered with. 

For all its brilliance, the Penny Black was technically a failure. At first, post offices used 
red ink to cancel stamps so that they could not be used again. But the ink could be removed, 
When in IK42. it w as determined that black ink would be more robust, the colour of the 
Penny Black became a sort of brow ny red, but Hill's brainchild had made its mark.

You should spend about 20 minutes on Questions 1-13. which are based on Reading Passage 1 below. 

The Phoenicians: an almost forgotten people 


The Phoenicians inhabited the region of modem 
Lebanon find Syria from about 3000 BC. They 
became the greatest traders of the pro-classical 
world, and were the lirst people to establish a large 
colonial netw ork. Both of these activities vs ere 
based on seafaring, an ability the Phoenicians 
developed from the example of their maritime 
predecessors, the Minoans of Crete, 

An Egyptian narraliv e of about 1080 I3C. the Stoiy 
of Wen-Amen , pros ides an insight into the scale 
of their trading aetiv ity. One of the characters is 
Werokei-El. a Phoenician merchant liv mg at Tunis 
in Egypt’s Nik- della. As many as 50 ships cany out 
his business, plying back and forth between the Nile 
and the Phoenician port ofSidon 

The most prosperous period for Phoenicia was the 
10th century BC, when the surrounding region was 
stable. Hiram, the king of the Phoenician city of 
Tyre, was an ally and business partner of Solomon, 
King of Israel. For Solomon’s temple in Jerusalem, 
Hiram provided craftsmen with particular skills that 
were needed for this major construction project. 

He also supplied materials - particularly timber, 
including cedar from the forests of Lebanon. And 
the two kings w ent into trade in partnership. They 
sent out Phoenician vessels on long expeditions (of 
up to three years for the return trip) to bring back 
gold, sandalwood, ivory, monkeys and peacocks 
from Ophir. This is an unidentified place, probably 
on the east coast of Africa or (he west coast of India. 

Phoenicia w as famous for ils luxury goods. The 
cedar wood was not only exported as top-quality 
timber for architecture and shipbuilding. El was also 
carved by the Phoenicians, and the same skill was 
adapted to even more precious w ork in iv ory, The 
rare and expensive dye for cloth, Tyrian purple, 
complemented another famous local product, fine 
linen. The metal u orkers of the region, particularly 


those working in gold, were famous. Tyre and Sidcm 
were also known for their glass. 

These were the main products which the 
Phoenicians exported, In addition, as traders and 
middlemen, they took a commission on a much 
greater range of precious goods that they transported 
from el sew here. 

The extensive trade of Phoenicia required much 
book-keeping and correspondence, and it was in the 
field of writing that the Phoenicians made their most 
lasting contribution to world history. The scripts 
in use in the world up to the second millennium 
BC (in Egypt, Mesopotamia or China) all required 
the writer to (cam a large number of separate 
characters - each of them expressing either a whole 
word or an element of ils meaning. By contrast, 
the Phoenicians, in about 15(K) BC, developed an 
entirely new approach to w riling. The marks made 
(with a pointed tool called a stylus, on damp clay) 
now attempted to capture the sound of a word. This 
required an alphabet of individual letters. 

The trading and seafaring skills of die Phoenicians 
resulted in a network of colonies, spreading 
westwards through the Mediterranean. The lirst was 
probably Citium, in Cyprus, established in die 9lh 
century BC. Bill the main expansion came from 
the 8th century BC onwards, w hen pressure from 
Assyria to the east disrupted the patterns of trade on 
the Phoenician coast. 

Trading colonies were developed on the string of 
islands in the centre of the Mediterranean Crete, 
Sicily, Malta. Sardinia, Ibiza and also on the coast 
of north Africa. 1'he African colonies clustered in 
particular around the great promontory which, w idi 
Sicily opposite, forms the narrowest channel on the 
main Mediterranean sea route. This is tile site of 
Carthage. 


306 






Reading 


Carthage was I lie largest of the towns founded by 
the Phoenicians on the north African coast, and 
it rapidly assumed a leading position among the 
neighbouring colonies. The traditional date of its 
founding is 814 HC. but archaeological evidence 
suggests that it was probably settled a little over a 
century laier. 

Thc subsequent spread and growth of Phoenician 
colonics in the western Mediterranean, and even out 
to the Atlantic coasts of Africa and Spain, was as 
much the achievement of Carthage as of the original 
Phoenician trading cities such as Tyre and Sidon. But 
no doubt links were maintained w ith the horn eland, 
and new colonists continued to travel west. 


from the 8th century BC, many of the coastal 
cities of Phoenicia came under the control of 
a succession of imperial pow ers, each of them 
defeated and replaced in the region by the next: first 
the Assyrians, then the Babylonians, Persians and 
Macedonian Greeks. 

In 64 BC, the area of Phoenicia became pan of the 
Roman province of Syria. The Phoenicians as an 
identifiable people then faded from history, merging 
into the populations of modem Lebanon and 
nonhem Syria,

The Hollywood Film Industry 

A This chapter examines the ‘Golden Age' of the Hollywood him studio system 
and explores how a particular kind of filmmaking developed during this period 
in US film history. It also focuses on the two key elements which influenced the 
emergence of Ihe classic Hollywood studio system: the' advent of sound and 
the business ideal of vertical integration. In addition to its historical interest, 
inspecting the growth (if the studio system may offer dues regarding the kinds 
of struggles that accompany the growth of any new medium, h might, in fact, 
he intriguing to examine which changes occurred during the growth of the 
Hollywood studio, and compare those changes to contemporary struggles 
in which production companies are trying to define and coni ml emerging 
industries, such as online film and interactive television. 

B The shill of the indusiry away fmm ‘silent' films began during lhe late 1920s. Warner 
Bros,' 1927 film 'fix' Jazz Singer was the first to feature synchronized speech, and 
with it came a period of turmoil for the industry. Studios now had proof that ‘talkie 1 
films would make them money, but the financial investment I his kind of filmmaking 
would require, from new camera equipment to new projection facilities, made the 
studios hesitant to invest at first In the end. the power of cinematic sound to both 
move audiences and enhance the story persuaded studios that talkies were worth 
investing in, Overall, the use of sound in film was well-received by audiences, but 
there were still many technical factors to consider. Although full integration of 
sound into movies was complete by 19-JO. ii would lake somewhat longer for them 
to regain their stylistic elegance and dexterity. The camera now had to he encased 
in a big, clumsy, immoveable soundproof box. In addition, actors struggled, having 
to direct their speech to awkwardly-hidden microphones in huge plants, telephones 
or even costumes. 

C Vertical integral ion is 1 he other key component in the rise of the 1 IoJlywood 
studio system. The major studios realized they could increase their profits by 
handling each Stage of a film’s life; production (making the f ilm ), distribution 
(getting the film out to people) and exhibition (owning the theaters in major 
cities where films were shown first). Five studios, The Big Five*, worked to 
achieve vertical integration through the laic 1940s, owning vast real estate on 
which to construct elaborate seis, In addition, these studios set the exact terms 
of films’ release dates and patterns, Warner Bros.. Paramount, 20th Century Fox. 
MGM and RKOformed this exclusive club. The Little Three’ studios - Universal, 
Columbia and United Artists - also made pictures, but each lacked one of the 
crucial elements of vertical integration. Together these eight companies operated 
as a mature oligopoly, essentially running the entire market-

I) During the Golden Age, the si udios were remarkably consistent and si able 
enterprises, due in large part to long-term management heads -the infamous 
movie moguls' who ruled I heir kingdoms with iron fists. At MGM, Warner 
Bros, and Columbia, the same men ran 1 heir studios for decades. The rise of 
the studio system also hinges on the treatment of stars, who were constructed 
and exploited (o suit a studios imago and schedule. Actors were bound up in 
seven-year contracts to a single studio, anti the studio boss generally held ait the 
options. Stars could be loaned out to other production companies at any time. 
Studio bosses could also force bad roles on actors, and manipulate every single 
detail of stars' images with their mammoth in-house publicity departments. 

Some have compared the Hollywood studio system to a factory, and it is useful 
to remember that si udios were out to make money first and ait second, 

E On the other hand, studios also had to cultivate flexibility, in addition to 

consistent factory output. Studio heads realized that they couldn’t make virtually 
the same film over and over again with t he same cast of stars and still expect to 
keep turning a profit. They also had to create product differentiation. Examining 
how each production company tried to differentiate itself has led to loose 
characterizations of individual studios’ styles. MGM tended to put out a loi of 
all-star productions while Paramount excelled in comedy and Warner Bros, 
developed a reputation for gritty social realism. 20th Century Fox forged the 
musical and a great deal of prestige biographies, while Universal specialized in 
classic horror movies. 

F In 1948, struggling independent movie producers and exhibitors finally 

triumphed in their battle against the big studios' monopolistic behavior. In the 
United States versus Paramount federal decree of that year, the studios were 
ordered to give up their theaters in what is commonly referred to as ‘divestiture* 
- opening the market to smaller producers. This, coupled with the advent of 
television in the 1950s, seriously compromised the studio system's influence and 
profits. Hence, 1930 and 1948 are generally considered bookondsto Hollywood's 
Golden Age.

THE HOLLYWOOD STUDIOS 

Throughout its Golden Age, the Hollywood movie industry was controlled by a handful of studios. 

Using a system known as 24.. the biggest studios not only made movies, but 

handled their distribution and then finally showed them in their own theaters, These studios were often

Reading Passage 3 below. 

Left or right? 

An overview of some research into lateralisation: the dominance of 
one side of the body over the other 

A Creatures across the animal kingdom have a preference lor one foot, eye or even 
antenna, The cause of this trait, called lateralisation, is fairly simple: one side of the 
brain, which generally controls the opposite side of the body, is more dominant than the 
other when processing certain tasks. This does, on some occasions, let the animal down; 
such as when a toad fails to escape from a snake approaching from the right, just because 
its right eye is worse at spotting danger than its left. So why would animals evolve a 
characteristic that seems to endanger them? 

B l : or many years it was assumed that lateralisation was a uniquely human trait, but this 
notion rapidly fell apart as researchers started uncovering evidence of lateralisation in 
all sorts of animals. For example, in the 1970s, Lesley Rogers, now at the University of 
New England in Australia, was studying memory and learning in chicks. She had been 
injecting a chemical into chicks' brains to stop them learning how to spot grains of food 
among distracting pebbles, and was surprised to observe that the chemical only worked 
when applied to the left hemisphere of the brain. That strongly suggested that the right 
side of the chick’s brain played little or no role in the learning of such behaviours. 

Similar evidence appeared ill songbirds and rats around the same time, and since then, 
researchers have buil t up an impressive catalogue of animal lateralisation, 

C In some animals, lateralisation is simply a preference ibr a single paw or foot, while in 
others it appears in more general patterns of behaviour. The left side of most vertebrate 
brains, for example, seems to process and control feeding. Since the left hemisphere 
processes input from the right side of the body, that means animals as diverse as fish, 
toads and birds are more likely to attack prey ot food items viewed with their right eye, 
Even humpback whales prefer to use the right side of their jaws to scrape sand eels from 
the ocean floor 

D Genetics plays a part in determining lateralisation, but environmental factors have an 
impact too. Rogers found that a chick’s lateralisation depends on whether il is exposed 
to tight before hatching from its egg - if it is kept in the dark during this period, neither 
hemisphere becomes dominant. In 2004, Rogers used this observation to test the 
advantages of brain bias in chicks faced with the challenge of multitasking. She hatched 
chicks with either strong or weak lateralisation, then presented the two groups with 
food hidden among small pebbles and the threatening shape of a fake predator Hying 
overhead. As predicted, the birds incubated in the light looked for food mainly with 
their right eye, white using the other to check out the predator. The weakly-laterabsed 
chicks, meanwhile, had difficulty performing these two activities simultaneously. 


313 




Test 8 


E Similar results probably bold true for many other animals. In 2006, Angelo Btsam at 
the University of Padua set out to observe the differences in feeding behaviour between 
strongly-1 a teralised and weakly-1 ate ralised fish. He found that strongly-latent Used 
individuals were able to feed twice as fast as weaklv-lateralised ones when there was 
a threat of a predator looming above them. Assigning di Herein jobs to different brain 
halves may be especially advantageous for animals such as birds or fish, whose eyes are 
placed on the sides of their heads. This enables them to process input from each side 
separately, with di lie rein tasks in mind, 

F And what of those animals who favour a specific side tor almost all tasks? In 2009, Maria 
Magat and Culum Brown al Macquarie University in Australia wanted to sec if there 
was general cognitive advantage in lateral isat ion, To investigate, they turned to parrots, 
which can be either strongly right - or left-footed, or ambidextrous (without dominance), 
l lie parrots were given the intellectually demanding task of pulling a snack on a string 
tip to their beaks, using a co-ordinated combination of claws and beak. Tire results 
showed that the parrots with die strongest foot preferences worked out the puzzle far 
more quickly than their ambidextrous peers, 

G A further pu z?.k is why arc thcre always a few exceptions, like left-handed humnns, 
who arc wired differently from the majority of the population? Giorgio Vallortigara 
and Stefan(i (ihirlanda of Stockholm University seem to have found I he answer via 
mathematical models. These have shown that a group offish is likely to survive a shark 
attack with the fewest casualties if the majority turn together in one direction while a very 
small proportion of the group escape in the direction dial the predator is not expecting. 

H This i mba I a nee of late ra I i sal ion with in populat ions in ay a iso have ad va n t ages for 

individuals. Whereas most co-operative interactions require participants to react 
similarly, there are some situations - such as aggressive interactions - where it can 
benefit an individual to launch an attack from an unexpected quarter Perhaps this can 
partly explain the existence of left-handers in human societies. Il has been suggested 
that when it comes to hand-to-hand lighting, left-handers may have the advantage over 
the riglit-handed majority. Where survival depends on the element of surprise, it may 
indeed pay to be different.

Learn to Skydive 

Accelerated Freefail (AFF) is art intensive skydiving course and you can 
experience freefal! on your very first jump. We offer the AFF Level 1 course as a 
unique introduction to the woiid of parachuting and skydiving. It’s great as a one- 
off freefall experience. However, the full eight-level Accelerated Freefall course is 
the best way to learn to skydive and attain your licence as a qualified parachutist, 
which allows you to jump at skydiving centres across the world, 

The AFF Level 1 course begins with an intensive day of ground training. During 
the day, you will learn how your parachute equipment works and how to check 
and fit it, how to exit the aircraft, how to maintain the correct body position in 
the air, monitor your altitude and deploy your parachute and how to deal with 
emergencies. The day will finish with a written test. The training can be both 
mentally and physically tiring so you should slay overnight if you wish to do your 
first jump the next day. For safety reasons we require you to return and jump in 
less than a month after your training in order to complete the Level 1 course. 

When you come to do your jump you will receive refresher training before you 
board the aircraft. You will exit the aircraft with two AFF Level 1 instructors. They 
wilt provide in-air coaching as they fall alongside you, holding onto your harness. 
You will experience about one minute of freefall and deploy your own parachute, 
then fly and navigate for around five minutes before landing on the dropzone. 
Following this, you will meet your instructors to debrief the jump and col feet your 
certificate. Shortly after you arrive home, you will receive an email link to the 
instructors' footage of your skydive to post online. 

There are some restrictions for solo skydiving. The maximum acceptable weight 
is 95 kg fully clothed and a reasonable level of fitness is required. As far as age is 
concerned, the minimum is 16 and a parental signature of consent is required for 
students of 16-17 on three forms. Adults over 45 wishing to skydive must bring 
a completed Declaration of Fitness form signed and stamped by their doctor. 
Acceptance rests with the head instructor.

Mistakes when applying for a job 

There are many mistakes that people make when writing their resume (CV) or 
completing a job application. Here are some of the most common and most serious. 

The biggest problem is perhaps listing the duties for which you were responsible in a 
past position: all this tells your potential employers is what you were supposed to do. 
They do not necessarily know the specific skills you used in executing them, nor do 
they know what results you achieved - both of which are essential. In short, they won’t 
know if you were the best, the worst, or just average in your position. 

The more concrete information you can include, the better. As far as possible, provide 
measurements of what you accomplished. If any innovations you introduced saved 
the organization money, how much did they save? If you found a way of increasing 
productivity, by what percentage did you increase it? 

Writing what you are trying to achieve in life - your objective - is a waste of space. It 
tells the employer what you are interested in. Do yog really think that employers care 
what you want? No, they are interested in what they want! Instead, use that space for 
a career summary. A good one is brief - three to four sentences long. A good one will 
make the person reviewing your application want to read further. 

Many resumes list hard’ job-specific skills, almost to the exclusion of transferable, or 
'soft’, skills. However, your ability to negotiate effectively, for example, can be just as 
important as your technical skills. 

All information you give Should be relevant, so carefully consider the job for which you 
are applying. If you are applying for a job that is somewhat different than your current 
job, it is up to you to draw a connection for the resume reviewer, so that they will 
understand hdw your skills will fit in their organization. The person who reviews your 
paperwork will not be a mind reader. 

If you are modest about the skills you can offer, or the results you have achieved, a 
resume reader may take what you write literally, and be left with a low opinion of your 
ability: you need to say exactly how good you are. On the other hand, of course, never 
stretch the truth or lie-

Clog dancing’s big street revival 

A The streets of Newcastle* in the north-east of England, have begun to echo with a sound 
lliiu has not been heard for about a century A sharp* rhythmic knocking can be heard among 
the Saturday crowds in one of the city’s busiest in (enactions. It sounds a little like dozens 
of horses galloping along the street., but there arc none in sight. In fact, ii's the noise of a 
hundred people dancing in wooden shoes, or clogs. 

The shoppers arc about to he ambushed by the UK's biggest clog dance event. The hundred 
volunteers have been coached to perform a mass routine. For ten minutes, the dancers bring 
the city centre to a standstill, There are people dogging on oil drums and between the tables 
of pavement cates. A screaming, five-man team cuts through the onlookers and begins leaping 
over sw ords that look highly dangerous. Then, as swiftly as they appeared, the doggers melt 
back into the crowd, leaving the slightly stunned spectators to go about their business. 

B This strange manifestation is the brainchild of conductor C harles Hazlewood, whose 
conversion to clog dancing came through an encounter with a folk band* The Unt hunks* 
‘Rachel and Becky Unthank came to develop some ideas in my studio," 1 la/lewood 
says. 4 Suddenly, they got up and began to mark out the rhythm w ith their feet - it was an 
extraordinary blur of shuffles* clicks and clacks that was an entirely new music Ibr me. I 
thought. '"Whatever this is. I want more of if 7 

Hazlewood was inspired to travel to Newcastle to make a television programme, Conte 
Clog Dancing* in which he anti a hundred other people learn to clog in a fortnight. Yet when 
he first went out recruiting, local people seemed unaware of their heritage. ‘We went out 
on co the streets, looking Ibr volunteers, but nobody seemed to know anything about clog 
dancing; or if they did. they thought it originated in the Netherlands/ 

C The roots of dog dancing go back several hundred years, and lie in traditional dances 

of the Dutch, Native Americans and African-Americans, in which the dancer strikes the 
ground w ith their heel or toes, to produce a rhythm that's audible to everyone around. In 
England, dogging is believed to have first developed in the mid-IQlh century in the cotton 
mills of Lancashire* in the north-west, w here workers created a dance that imitated the 
sound of the machinery. The style quickly spread and developed a number of regional 
variations. In Northumberland, it became a recreation Ibr miners, who danced solo or to the 
accompaniment of a fiddle. 

l The Northumberland style is very distinct from Lancashire clogging,'says Laura Connolly, 
a virtuoso dancer who worked with Hazlewood on die programme. 'Northumbrian dancing 
is quite neat and precise w ith almost no upper-body movement, whereas the Lancastrian 
style is more flamboyant/ 

l) Whatever she region, clogging remains very much a minority pursuit. Yet at the turn of 
the 20th century, dogging was a fully-fledged youth craze. Two famous comic film actors. 
Stan Laurel and Charlie Chaplin, both began their careers as doggers. But the dance almost 
completely died out with the passing of the industrial age. 'People danced in clogs becaLase 
they were cheap, hard wearing and easily repaired/ Connolly says. L Yei eventually clogs 
became associated w ith poverty and people were almost ashamed to wear them/ 

E Fortunately, the key steps of the dances were preserved and handed down in a series of little 
blue books, often named after their inventors* ‘It means that we still know what Mrs Willis’s 
Rsig or Ivy Sands*s Hornpipe were like," Connolly says. 'It's my dream that one day there'll 
be a little blue book called Laura Connolly's Jig/ 


328 




Reading 


F Her biggest challenge to dale was to teach Hazlewood anil 1 00 other beginners a routine 
sufficiently accomplished to perform on television, from scratch, in less than two weeks. 'I 
started people off with something simple,' she says. 'It’s a basic shuttle that most people can 
pick up.'Once Hazlewood had absorbed the basics, Connolly encouraged him to develop 
a short solo featuring more complex steps - though he nearly came to grief attempting a 
tricky manoeuvre known as Charlie Chaplin Clicks, so named as it was the signature move 
of Chaplin's him character the Little Tramp, 

'To be honest. 1 never quite got those right,’ Hazlewood says with a laugh. ‘We came up 
with a slightly easier version, which Laura thought we should call Charlie HazLewood 
Clicks. The thing about clogs is that they're all surface: there's no grip and they're slightly 
curved so you stand in a slightly peculiar way. The potential lo fall over is enormous.' 

On the day. I fazlewood managed to pull off a decent solo, clicks and all. i w asn't 
convinced, until the moment I did it. that I was going to get it right.' he admits, ‘But 
in the end, clog dancing is not so very different from conducting. Both require you to 
communicate a beat - only I had to learn how to express it with my feet, rather than my 
hands. But it's a good feeling.’ 

G ’People forget that clogging was originally a street dance.' Connolly says, it was 
competitive, it was popular, and now young people are beginning to rediscover it Ibr 
themselves. As soon as we finished in Newcastle, I had kids coming up to me saying. "Clog 
dancing's cool - I want to do that!'”

good resources in the library are often all out at ibis lime 
of the year. Anyway, before wc notify the tutor which 
topic we've chosen, 1 think We need to ask the others what 
they're doing.

Jell therm that it's Free now. We used to charge for it and there 
was a ticket booth Eu the left ul die entrance, but now that it's 
been tu rned into a small stage, we hold cookery demonstrations 
lhere. Local chefs come in and show people how to prepare 
dishes. It's really popular and you get a nice view of the fountain 
there. We have over 50 stalls at tine markets, selling everything 
front fresh fruit and vegetables to Locally matte crafts. Which 
unfortunately means people won't find things like bonks or 
anything second-hand. We have a famous baker at the market 
and many people get here really early just to buy his produce. 

His stall is located at the back of the markets next 10 a he 
barbecue. We sell burgers and sausages there but a Joe of people 
like to bring their Own hunch to eat and: they're welcome to go 10 
the special area near the tree in the middle oF the markets where 
they can do Just that. It's handy for the toilets too. The markets 
are located next to a circus school that holds classes fur children 
at the weekend, su we often get a lot oE family groups in. 

There's a playground on the right-hand side that's popular with 
them, and just in front of that is where the farmers bring along 
chickens, rabbits and lambs for the children to pel. That's always 
a very popular lean ire so you'll definitely be asked about that. 
Just Jet people know there is a small Fee il the children warn to 
Feed them. Well, 1 bat's everything fur now...

elevate the base and help witFi that. The base also has another 
use as it can also hold up to 10 spare (tarty poppers! So you 
never need to worry about running out. Once the motor is 
running, it turns the spiky wheel that is attached to the loaded 
party popper. 1 call this the detonator! As it nuns, t he string of

A: Right, let's organise our presentation on the new science 
equipment, shall we? 

B: Yes, I'm a bit worried ii's overly long - we only have 
10 minutes. 

A: Why don'i we go through each section then, 

B: OK. what about the introduction? I think that's OK. 

A: Hmni. It's not very exciting. 

R: [ don't ihink we should eui any of it though, 

A: Of course, anti we can si si I do it the same way, but maybe 
we should bring along sonic actual equipment? 

B: Great idea, dial would help grab their alien don. Now, nest 
we look at the benefits of this technology We've got plenty 
about that. 

A: I agree. In fact, some ol the ones we've chosen are pretty 
obvious, l think, perhaps we could leave some out? 

B: Agreed. And Htai would save some time. 

A* Yes, now, when ii comes io the negatives, ] J d like to 
profuse something a link* different. 

B: 1 like that section, it's always enjoyable hearing about 
technology going wrong? 

A: Well, we've got a lew 6houghl-provoking quotes from 
people who've encountered s|iecHKc problems. And we 
were planning on just reading them out but I think we 
should video them and play the recording instead. 


R: Oh that would be belter And if we use a variety of media, 

I ihink well get a higher mark. 

A: Yes. That's what I was thinking, 

B: OK. let 's give ii a try Now. what about the conclusion? 
Should we include something else? IVs pretty short at 
the moment, 

A; Yl"i. hut I think ihat's OK. There's not much more to say 
really 1 . We've already verified all our sources, so 1 don't 
think there’s anything else leh in do. 

R* Well, I think TIE do an Internet search anyway, just 
to be sure we haven’t missed anything. 

A: QK, it would he good to be able to state that we have 
included all the very latest Information. 

R: Absolutely.

A; How are we going to get lo ihc airport on Monday? Shall 
we gel a taxi? 

il: It would he nice and convenient but the fare is so expensive. 
Ai Thai s true. Well, if you want so save money, we could 
always take she bus. 

R: It might be cheaper but the bus doesn't start running until 
7 o'clock and we need to be at Hie airport by t>. E li my 
sister it she can give us a lift. 

A: That would lx* great if she could drive us. 

II: Yes. I'm sure she won t mind. 

Section i 

A: So, what else have w e got to do? 

B: Weil, we've gathered enough information, 1 don't think we 
need to lind out any more. 

A: You're right. Should we go and see Professor Smith, then? 
We could ask his advice. 

R: Well he could check it lor us and make sure we've 
done enough. But I'd rather do that after we've pul 
it all together. At ihe moment, we only have a lot ol 
handwritten notes. I don't want lo show him that. 

Al OK. Let's divide the material up and each put it on to a disc 
so that we can print of I a nicely presented copy.

1 Identifying main ideas 

ifc*D 

Good morning, everyone. My name is Paul and I'm a 
palaeontologist. Now, when nu^J people hear that, they 
im rued lately get L ui image Of an old pro lessor studying dried-up 
dinosaur bones or else they think ol a great adventurer from 
die movies! Welt, I'm neither. But I would like to talk to you 
today about how L came to be a palaeontologist and l fie reason 
i believe it is an important job. All my life, my main interest has 
been the environment. So. ] actually started nut as an ecology 
student. As a pari of my degree course, I had to do a compulsory 
iiiiii on extinction and a lecturer visiting from another university 
gave us a talk on Australia's extinct animals- One of the animats

hi* la Iked about was called the Diprottidoji. It's an ancestor uJ 
the modem Australian wombat. He described this enormous 
animal crossingancient lakes, getting stuck in the mud and 
becoming [Kin of the lossil record, which is what we tali the 
preserved remains of animals and pLint> dial we Find. And I was 
fasti luted. So fascinated that J immediately changed courses. 

Bui palaeontology isn't all easy ping. The very Eirsi field trip 
i went on was pretty awful and we didn't lind anything! We 
went to an outback lossil site and u c were digging in extreme 
conditions. ! J ve learned since then ihai that's pretty standard 
for work like this. But to make matters worse 1 , alter five days, 
] J d found nothing, I was getting really disheartened ami I was 
starling to regret my decision, when on the last day of the trip. 

1 was digging into the bank ol an ancient dried-up riverbed 
and I Jonrid a funny-looking piece of rock. Inside it was a tooth 
from a giant kangaroo. Finding that one fossil made me realise 
that this was a held I really wanted to continue working in. 

2 Understanding how ideas are connected 

m 

1 

A; I don't really understand why you contacted Professor 
Higgins, lie has nothing to do with our faculty. 

Ii- Well we wanted to understand what impact an invention 
like this would have on the environment. And that's his 
area of expertise 1 . 

2 

A: First of all we put video cameras in the animals" cages .,, 

Ii: Yes, arid then We pul various tools inside the cages and let 
the animals back in. 

A: Wl 1 video-recorded them over seven days and nights to see 
what they would do with the tools, 

* 

Alter gathering alt ol our data, we looked at the results. We 
realised lliat the number ol Irogs in this area had actually 
increased over the last 10 years rather than declined. 

4 

A: So, what does that all show? 

IIl Well, l think we can deduce from this that any 
development in this area should be halted until the 
anlnuh have all been safely removed. 

\EE) 

What r appreciate most about my work is the fact that I can 
turn the loss its J Find into information we can actually use So, 
how di» we extract that information? Well, First we need to 
run the fossil through a sjkc^I machine. That gives me a date 
for the fossil. From then on r 1 In-giu to work out what type 
ol animal it was, what it ate and bow it interacted with the 
landscape. 

Earlier this year. 1 was lucky enough to he awarded a grant front 
a government-binding body. Palaeontology isnT only about the 
past. It can help with current issues too. For example, E plan to 


Use these funds to excavate new areas and try to lind luii how 
ancient creatures evolved during ilicir own period of climate 
change, just as animals today have to. 

hi another project. Pin going to study fossil collections that arc 
housed in museums around Australia. I'm doing that to try to 
find out when Australia's mega-fauna became extinct - that k, 
all the glam mammals, lizards and birds. That will help us to 
finally find nut what caused I best 1 extinct ions. Was Ll nature or 
was i; humans? 

3 Understanding an explanation 

(fe»)

We've recently been doing some research involving mice. We 
were trying in find out what causes the cells in mir body to 
age. Is ii linked to diet or exercise? What we found was that if 
we allowed the mice no expertise, their cells deteriorated lairly 
rapidly, giving them a prematurely old body. The mice that 
did exercise, showed less change in their ceil structure and so 
seemed younger. 

2 

We've known For decades that pigeons can navigate using the 
Earth's magnetic held as a sort ol compass, what we don’t 
know is how this works. In our research, we discovered that 
the pigeon's brain receives a signal from its middle car that the 
brain then processes to determine hoib their direction and the 
strength ol the magnetic field. Previously, it had been thought 
that it ivan the bird's honk that held the answer. But ibis has 
since been proven false,

a great deed of changes were taking place.

information,

2 Comparing and contrasting ideas 



In my talk tinlay I’m going to be looking at plants iluu have 
had an impact on our world ami our history Let's start with 
the potato. 3 e was originally one of the staple foods nF Central 
anti South America and when Spanish explorers travelled to 
the Americas some time in the 16ih century the potato found 
ith way into Europ e. This had several important consequences, 
hi particular, it almost totally altered peoples dki In many 
European countries. The potato is also believed to have been 
responsible for the start oE a new trend -that ol migrating lo

America, So you could say that the 1 humble potato actually 
allowed many people 10 change their iLvcs . 

Howevcr, there were also problems asst>daleri with ilm crop. 
Largely in Ireland where the poor were very much redan* 
on the success of the crops. Sadly, a disease in the crop spread 
rapidly across the country and led to widespread potato crop 
failures in the mid-1800s. This meant lhai millions died from 
Harv ai itill as a result 

Let's move on in look at another plant from the same part of 
the world, the tobacco plant. This originated in the Americas 
and had an enormous influence on the way North America 
developed in the 1800*. It’s famed lor being the original cash 
crop there and for funding a great deal of the development that 
occurred during this lime. 

On the downside, the success of this crop resulted in a greater 
demand for slaves lo work rite crops and this eventually led 
in war breaking out between the Northern States and those in 
the South. 

Now, the next plant rd like to mention is one known and 
used all around the world- Tea . Ji originated in China and in 
terms of its historical significance, it played a large pari In the 
US independence from Great Britain. This came about because 
the British government declared that the colonics had lo pay 
a on l he produce brought into America. It was because of 
the protest against these taxes that lhe American Revolution 
came aboui. 

The final plant ill look at today w the White Mulberry. 

Again it originated in China and had an enormous Influence 
on development hi this part ol the world,, in particular in 
establishing trade between the East and the West. Sadly, 
the increase ill trade brought with il the spread of disease 
anti weapons. 

3 Using notes to follow a talk 

M 

In today's lecture. I'm going to talk about the pari I hat plains 
have played in our history, something mosl of us probably 
never give any Thoughi to. Flowers began changing the 
way the world looked almost as soon as they appeared on 
Earth about 130 mill ion years ago. Thai's relatively recent in 
geologic time - if all Earth’s history were compressed into an 
hour flowering plains would exist for only the last 90 seconds. 
Without those flowering plants, it's likely we wouldn't lie 
here. They are fundamental to our existence, forming a vital 
part of our lood supplies. 

EF we look further on In lime, to the year 2737 RC, we arrive 
at cite discovery oE tea by a Chinese emperor, when a leaf fell 
imo a cup oi hoi water. This discovery eventually played a 
very important pan in the history of China, the USA and the 
UK, For Britain, where demand (or lea was high, there were 
Financial implications when a Chinese emperor declared iFiat it 
could only be bought with silver , which they were then forced 
to And overseas. 

A second influential planl emerged a round 202 RC Ln the form 
of the While Mulberry. It became extremely sought after and 
it remained so until 220 AJ.5 because white mulberries provide 


lood lor the worm that creates silt. This luxurious material was 
responsible Eor establishing extremely valuable trade routes. 

A ud ii was a long these same routes that different jxligiQlb 
made iheir way around the world- But. unionunmely, they 
also caused the spread oF previously unknown diseases, as well 
as weapons of war such as gunpowder . 

Finally, moving into more recent history, we come Eo llie I6lh 
century and ihe potato, h originated in Central America hut 
ii was the Spanish who introduced il to the European diet. 
There, ii quickly became popular because not only did it cosi 
little to grow, but ii was also a Fond source ihai was rich in 
vitamins . So much so lhat ils arrival has been credited with 
ridding Britain of a disease known as scurvy. However, it is 
perhaps inure famous now Fur ihe potato famines oE rite mid- 
1800s in Ireland. Tin- Irish people were so dv|K h urierct un the 
crop that its widespread failure over this period caused ihe 
deaths of over a million people and the cmiktqrion oE a further 
million io mainland Britain. Canada and [he US.

Pacton-omSea is a beaus if ul west coast sown and has attracted 
tourists For many years. One of the best ways of gening 10 
know ilie town is 10 lake ihe bus tour, which provides a 
wonderful viewing experience hum one ol our open-top 
buses. The lour is a round-trip of ihe town and ihe re are a 
Iotal of 4 slops where passengers can gel on and off the bus. A 
Ini of people start at ihe Eiim slop which is at the train station 
as Hi is is where many tourists arrive in ihe town. The nest 
stop after the station is ihe aquarium which is famous tor its 
dolphin show and which has recon I Ey expanded to include 
sharks . This is well worth a visit and is very reasonably priced. 
Leaving the aquarium, the bus four goes along (he coast road 
and after a few kilometres comes to ihe OldJirllltJg Village 
where you can gel off to stroll a tong the waterfront- There are 
some original buildings here bill ruosl of the area has been 
modernised and is now used as a harbour for all kinds of sea 
trail including yachts and some amazing power boats. The 
lour iheii heads off to tfie Iasi slop and ihis is where must of 
ihe shops a re. So lor those of you keen to do a bil (4 sh opping 
ihis is ihe place for you. Our advice is to go to this part of the

Now some details ol the costs and timings. A family ticket, 
which includes two adults and up lo three children, costs £“*<), 
An adult ticket costs £15. children under the age id fifteen are 
and student tickets are £10 as long as you has r e a 
student c ard. All liekels are valid lor 24 hours, which means 
then you can get on and oil the bus as many times as you like 
within a 24-hour period. So you could, lor example, start she 
tour In the afternoon and rompLeie it the following mo riling. 
The first bus of the day leaves the station at 30 am and the 
last one of ihe day leaves at 6 pm. Eiuses leave every thirty 
minutes and each tour takes a km a! of fifty nmunes . There 
are many attractions at each of the slops, so wherever you 
get olf die bus ihere will be plenty io do. The bits innr tickets 
do not include entrance lo any of these attractions apart from 
the mus eum which is Unruled near the aquarium. Some buses 
have local guides, who will point tun places of interest and 
will provide in format ion on lire town. However, we cannot 
guarantee I hat every bus will have a guide and so we also 
haw an audio commentary chat lias been specially recorded 
for ihe bits tour by the looris i oEEkc. Headphones are available 
on the bos and these are easy to operate. There 1 is no extra 
charge for these - just plug in. select the required language 
and adjust ihe volume. 

Due to the winter months being rasher cold and wet in Pacton- 
on-Sea. ilie bus mure only operate from March to September. 
The weather is usually warm and sunny dtiring these months 
so remember to bring some sun protection, especially on 
hoi days. And of course, ii does occasionally rain here in the 
summer so if ihe weather looks had, remember to bring some 
laitm ear The bus tours are available no matter whai ihe 
weather. 


At the height ol the summer the lours can gel very busy so 
you are advised in book. You can book rickets online, over 
the phone and also at the station and at any ol the other tour 
stops. When hooking over the plume you can collect your

Hi everyone - today I'm going to be talking about the origins 
of ceramics. So, lirst of all. let's Stan off with - what is a 
ceramic? Well, generally speaking, ceramics are what you get 
when you apply heat to certain inorganic non'metallic solids 
and then allow ihem to cool. And examples of ceramics are 
everyday things like earthenware pots, crockery, glassware 
and even concrele. 


So how did it all begin? Well it a LI started around 2V,UUU years 
ago when humans discovered that If you dig up some soft clay 
Emm ilie ground, mould il in so a shape and then heal it up 
[o a very high temperature, when it cools the clay has been 
transformed into something hard and rigid. And so - wltal did 
those first humans do with their discovery? Well - they created 
ligutines which were small statues and which depicted animals 
or gods or any shape that the day could he moulded inlo. And 
all this activity was cent red around southern Europe where 
there is also evidence of ceramics lhat were treated much later. 

The early humans also found a practical use Eor their 
discovery, such as storing things like grain - although there 
were drawbacks. The pots were porous so that, although they 
could carry jmisrf In them, ii wasn't pussiM* to flm.' h over 
a long period. AeuI also, they were quite brittle and siutiered 
very easily if they were dropped. 

Bui despite these problems, Li was many thousand* of years 
before there were any improvements, In China at around 
200 BC. they discovered lhat by adding minerals to the clay 
they could Improve Imth the appearance and the strength of 
the ceramics, Bui is look nearly a thousand years before they 
perfected the process to produce high-quality ceramics known 
as porcelain. And once they hail perfected the process, they 
kept ii a secrei - ior another thousand yearsl Compared to the 
first ceramics, porcelain was lighter, finer, harder arid whiter 
and became an Important commodity in China's trading with 
Ihe rest of the world for hundreds of years.. En laci r u became 
so valuable that it was known a*, while g old and spies were 
seni to China to discover what ihey did to die clay to produce 
such high-quality merchandise. 

It wasn’t until the eighteenth century llial the secret began to 
unravel. A German alchemist called fohann Friedrich Bnttger 
was asked hy ihe king to make gold out of lead. Unfortunately. 
Bnttger failed to achieve this ami soon gave up r but in order to 
please the king be attempted En make high-quality pnrcelain. 
And jLut many years ol experimentation, he discovered that 
by adding quart* and a material called dim a s ione to very 
high-quality day he managed En gel the same results that the 
Chinese had been achieving lor the last L,D00 years, 

Well now look at another ceramic which is made from mixing 
sand with minerals and heating m over 600 degrees Celsius. 
When this mixture cods the result is ol course glass. The main 
difference be!ween ceramics made from day and glass U that 
clay is made up ol crystalline plates which become lucked 
together in ihe tuuliiig process whereas glass cools too quickly 
for crystals to form . Apart from that, the process of healing up 
naturally occurring materials lo transform [hem is the some. 

Tbe origins of glass date back to 1500 BC but 11 wasn't 
until the Roman Empire. 2,QOO years ago, dut the art ol 
glass-blowing and the practical tews nF glass became more 
widespread. One of the more innovative uses u as 10 use it in 
windows as r up nnill then, they had just been holes in walls, Il 
must have been very draughty Bn those days! 

The Romans were also responsible for Inventing concrete 
And although the origins are uncertain, experts think that 
this. Is largely due in the high level of vulcanic activity in the 
area. The Romans observed that, when yuLCsUUVA^h mixes

with water and Them cools, it gets extremely bard and almost 
Impossible lu break up. The chemical reaction that follows is 
very complex and comhuic* for many years, and The concrete 
jusi keeps getting harder. Evidence nf this is the numerous 
Roman remains that are still standing, many ol which are 
almost completely intact. 

One of the most important facts about concrete for the 
Romans was that it can be created underwater As the Roman 
Empire grew, the Romans needed to lake control ol the 
seas and for this They needed to build harbours capable of 
holding a fleet of ships. Pouring concrete mixttire into the sea 
Immediately started the hardening process and rather than 
just dissolving in the mass of water the substance was rough 
and longdasling, This strange characteristic ol concrete made 
a significant contribution to the success of the Roman Empire.

main attractions Itkc die aquariinti, the crocodiles, die penguins 
jeuI “hs on are mill here. But we have a new restaurant and picnic 
area and die latest thing that Wf have - and it was only finished 
last week - is the Silas b ride - This is an exciting new area o( the 
centre and is pretty scary and of course you do get a liil wet so 
make sure you're noi wealing yourbesi dullest 

As I said, the main attractions an" still here and the most popular 
tEitny that everyone wants to set- is Feeding time, especially For 
Chc crocodiles am! die seals. We used to have die main feeding 
time in the afternoon at around ^ pm hut we found that some of 
the animals got a bit hungry waiting mu LI then and so we now 
have it ai mum . They seem much happier with the nuvv time - 
although it's a hit difficult to know what they're thinking! 

Now - rd like to mention something new dial we've 
introduced this year that we're very exciled about. It's called a 
VIP ticket. The VIP rickei costs an extra E2 per person and you 
will he amazed ai what il allows you to dn. With this you'll 
Lie a I Lowed to Iced I he sFiarks. Now I know that for some 
people this might he quite a frightening thing to do, hut ii i ,s 
perfectly safe, For those ol you who are a hit unsure, we do 
have a video you can watch in see what happens. It's a great 
experience ami your friends will be very impressed! 

Speaking of friends, J"d just like to remind you that the Sea Life 
Centre will be more than happy to organise a birthday party

y«u can speak to me afterwards and there are also Forms at the

rd atso like to bring your attention to the gmid work thal the 
Sea Life Centre is doing in support ol animal conservation 
] am sure you're all aware oi the worry ing situation with a 
large number of species facing extinction. Here at the Sea 
Life Centre we're taking action by asking as many people as 
possible to sign a petition. Once we have over 5,000 signatures 
we are planning to send it to the government in the hope that 
more people will begin eo take il seriously. 

Bight - well there's obviously a lot going on ai tile Centre, and 
a lot of things to discover. At all ilic attractions there is helpful 
Information so please read as much as you can and. if you 
want tii see wliai you've remembered,, please do the quiz a Her 
yoitr visit. There are no prizes of course, but I'm sure you'll be

So before I leave you ail eo start your lour. I've just got a few 
lips. There are a large number of attractions and you may nol 
have time to see them all. Ol course, there are the old Favourites 
like the Aquarium and the Crocodile Cave inn if you don't 
have ihnt r u> sc-e everything make sure you visit Turrk- Town , 
which is beyond the Aquarium and the Seal Centre. This is very 
special and has a large number ol endangered species, ami as it's 
at the Far corner oF tlie Sea Life Centre it often gels overlooked. 

T also have to apologise for the Penguin Park . This lias needed 
some urgent work to be done and so will not be open E«u tFie 
next week. We are very sorry about this but I'm sure you'll 
lind the Seal Centre which is directly apposite it will keep you

Listening Section 4 

Hello everyone. You've all been given an assignment lor your 
Sociology course which will involve giving a presentation to 
the rest nf the group. And m>. Unlay. l F m going to he giving you 
a few sipn on how in prepare your prese mat inns, This should 
help you with your current assignment - bin a lot ol the 
principles I II he pulling across will he general principles which 
will, of course, help you with all your future presen unions. 

So first of all ihe most importam ihing to consider is your 


audience and in ilns instance, your audience are (lie other 
Modems in your group. There are three pm ms to boar in mind. 
Firstly, you need to ask yourself what ihey need to know: 
secondly. it's use!id lo consider whether they'll be >UpporUYi: 
or not: and thirdly - will it be a small group say three or 
four, a moderate gathering ot twenty or so people las for your 
current assignment! or will there be hundreds ot people? 
Ipausff Having said all lhai. wiiai E'm about to tell you will 
apply equally to any audience. 

So - how do you sirudure your presentation? Right ai the 
beginning, vou should tell them something ilias forces ihem 
to pay attention. This could be something surprising or even 
shocking bin it needs to be rdevantl Alter that, you need a 
list l> 1 items or topics showing them whai you'll be covering 
- rather like an agenda - and then Lhe main pari ol the 
presentation tv ill follow. This mam pari will be the detailed 
information you'll he presen ling and could include facts, 
statisiics, personal experiences, etc. Alter iliis you should 
summarise what youYc presumed and close with whai I call 
next steps' . For this assignment. you could simply point lhe 
group to oilier Sociology reference material. In other eases, you 
may want (o suggest some actions that people can take, 

Now - what about die design of the slides lor your Laptop? 

Well die important tiling here is to be consistent - You need to 
have ihe same type of font and use the same colour and size 
for Lhe same elements. For example, all headers need to look 
ihe same, all bill lei points need lo be presen led in cite same 
way. And don't just stick m words- Bring the presentation to 
life by adding graphics . These could he in several forms such as 
picture*. !low-charts, diagrams, hwiogrants and. so on. 

And so - lel"s move on now to presenting. You have your 
prescniailon prepared and you're ready to start. Well - it's 
important to give a good impression from the start, So take 
three deep breaths. Look ai the audience, no mailer how 
frightening they may be, and be erithusiasiicand energetic. As 
you go ill rough the presentation remember to provide some 
variety in the way you speak. So, for example, you can talk 
fairly rapidly lor in forma lion that may be familiar, bin then 
slow down Jor more unfamiliar sections. And change your 
tune as you speak - don't keep h at the same level all the way 
through. As I mentioned r look ai your audience. Hr. a good tip 
is to pick people cun and look at them fm around five seconds. 
Not looking al the audience gives die impression dial you're 
either noi interested in them or tern (led of them. Looking 
loo lung at one particular person may make them feel rather 
uncomfortable. Tlu re may be points in your presentation lhai 
you want your audience to really absorb and In order to make 
important points stand mu you may consider adding sikmx 
righl aEier these. Jt wili give people time to reflcci on what 
you’ve jusi said. Also - you may he presuming complicated 
ideas or technical details but try lo keep everything as simple 
as possible. Use simple words and as few as possible. And be 
clear. IE you say something like This appears in he', it implies 
uncertainty. So using weak verb s such as 'appears, seems’, 
"could be", etc. needs lo be avoided. 

I'll just finish oft with a few thoughts tin questions and 
imctruplions from ihe audience. You may chnose to invite 


346 


















Recording scripts • 


questions I min die audience as you go or ask them to wail 
until the end. Either way, questions should he encouraged 
js ic provides you with Mime feedback on how interested the 
audience is and how well they're tmdereiandiiig you. When 
a question is asked you need 10 provide an answer ihai is as 
accurate as possible, So initially my tip is to re | icai u . This will 
ensure you have heard it correctly arid s% iti give you a few 
seconds to gather your thoughts. 

Interruptions, on the other hand, can lie unwelcome and you 
may gel lhem fora variety of reasons. It's likely, however, 
that lhere's something In your presentation ihatV unclear

Good morning everyone. I hope you're all leelinji OK after 
I he activities of ihe lost week or so, t know you've ail been 
working very hard recently and we've been exceptionally 
busy, especially with ihe wedding Iasi weekend and ihe trade 
Eair straight after that. And now we have only three days 
to prepare for the birthday party l his weekend* The events 
recently have gone extremely well ami the hotel is beginning 
It) get a very good reputation, so we need lo keep il up. At the 
moment, we don't haw exact numbers of guests and though 
we usually only cater for groups ul ^syihan lil iy. we tviU hove 
quite a lew more iha n that I said - not auc id numbers 

Inn ol cour se w e won't go ow e the maximum of 10P. But it's 
likely that we will need all of you to work this weekend so if 
any of you can't, please let me know as soon as possible. 

Right - so what time will the event start? Well the invitation 
says guests should arrive Inn ween 7.10 and 7,4 ■> but our 
experience is that there are always a few who like to arrive 
early so well expect the lino people at 2A1- Ah the numbers are 
quite large, this will certainly he the case. Fuod wiI[ Ik j served 
at around 8.10 and then, depending-mi how long Lite meal 
lakes, the entertainment will start about two hours later. Now, 
JL>r this, we were expecting a live hand for the occasion which 
is always h]ii P but apparently lilts Isas been cancelled due tu 
illness. So - the hosts know someone who is a comedian who 
will lie replacing ihe band, We had hoped that the resident 
magician who worked here through the summer would be able 
to help out but they weren't keen on that idea. 

Iptitisej 

So I d just like to go through who's doing what when the 
guests arrive and I think well make a few changes from the 
last party held lie re. II1 remember correctly, li was Olav who 
co-ordinated the task tif providing the guests with drinks or 
was il Ahmed? (checking} Uin, I'm not sure - hut Gary asked 
to do il tiiis time - ho that will he his job. There’s been ins 
decision yet on what the drinks are going to be bus I hope 
they deride soon in case we need lo order something special. 
Now - for receiving tiler guests' coats and hats. it's important 
we have someone experienced doing this as we don't want 
guests losing their belongings. And M o ni c a. Iasi time this 
was your responsibility. Susan. 1 know yon wanted to do 
this bm as the numbers are quite high Eoi this event I won't 
make a change here- Right - now last time there was some 
confusion js tii where gilt-sin Were supposed In go once they 
had deposited their things and we had guests roaming around 
the whole hotel. So Ahmed and Olav - t believe you discussed 
the problems with Susan and thought she would be good at 
guiding guests alter they had arrived - and I'm line with that. 

Right - and now for some general instructions. Once the 
guests have arrived they will he in and around the lounge area 
and then at around f1.30 we need to gel them tit move Id the 
restaurant [or their meal. This often proves difficult and can 
take a long rime so l will ring a hell so that everyone knows 
Lis lime to eat! Hopefully this will speed things up a bit. Also - 
lor this event there'll he a seating plan, so the guests wmVl be 


able to decide Eor them selves where to sit - they'll have to sit 
according to the plan. There'll be a plan on each table and I've 
been thinking about where lo pul the master plan so everyone 
can view it before they enter the restaurant. As they'll be 
spending quite a while in the loun^ g. I've decided to also pul a 
plan ibere. This should speed up the start of the meal. 

Once the meal starts, you'll all lie very busy waiting on die tables 
and I'm sure l don't need to id I you lobe good-humoured and 
polite to all the guests. Tile organiser of the event will be saying 
a few words and so will two of his colleagues. So when the 
speeches start all activity must stop in the restaurant so that the 
three people yivimi them can Ik beard, This shouldn't take long 
-and il should be towards the end of the meal. Alter that, ihe 
guests will move back lo the lounge lor the entertainment. 

So -1 think dial's il. Any questions - come and see me later.

Alan: Hi Melanie - whoi did you think ol the assignment that 
we got today? Il looks hue resting, doesn't U? 

Melanie: Yes Alan, I've always been interested iti recycling 
but there's a lot of research to do. 

Alan: Yes - there are a lot of things I'm unsure of so it's going 
to be good working with you. 

Melanie: OK - well why don't we start by making a flow¬ 
chart Jrom the notes our tutor gave us? 

Alan: Yes, urn, so ... on one side we could have the paper 
production cycle - here on the left - and cm live other side 
the recycling, 

Melanie: Good Idea. Let's start at the top with the production. 
The first step in the process is in get the raw materials, 
Alan: Yes - and they tend lo come from phielu-im^ . 

Melanie; ()K - and then ihe bark is removed from the outside 
nl ihe tree and after that the wood is chopped up - that's 
the first three stages. 

Alan: Et sounds a bis complicated a Her that. Um, it says water is 
added and then the mixture in heated and made into pulp. 
This will be the thick paste that is used to make paper, 
Melanie: Yes - you're right because after that they use a 
machine to make the paper and we can pul that right in 
the centre of the llow-chan because it's also where the 
recycled paper joins the process. 

A lan: Yes- So once the paper lias been produced in the 
machine, what happens then? 

Melanie: Well, I think we should write 'print' as the next 
step because this ts when newspapers, magazines, etc. are 
produced. And we could also add that they have to be 
distributed to stores and people's homes. 

Atant Right, then the recycling bit starts. The old paper s 
collected and then it says it's taken somewhere so that 
someone or something can sort it. I imagine there are 
ciillerent kinds of paper - or things like paper clips that 
need to be removed. 

Melanie: Yes. Let s have a step a her that. Now, how did our 
tutor say they do this? Oil yes - it involves chemicals, so - 
how in your chemistry?

similar to lhe last step in the production process wfedl

[pause! 

Alan So 1 think going through the processes helped. Now we 
need its decide 1 how wl-' re going to do this assign me m. 

Melanlet Yes, t guess what we need to do is take ihe processes 
and divide them tip between us. El Lit we could stan 
thinking atom an iniroduaion . 

Alart: Yes, UK well 3 can start doing ihat. J think l have 
enough 10 go on already, 

Melanie: Good. And there are a few areas where we need a 
lot more information, ] think i'll start with something easy 
- Jet's say the paper collection. I coiiid go in the resource 
centre to do some research. 

Alan: Well 3 ihink a beuer idea would he io approach 
someone who's involved in the process. What about 
contacting the aiuo£il? 

Melanie: Oh - good idea. Yes -II! do Lh.nl instead. They're

tiling (o L idd io our work to make it even more i merest mg. 

Alan: And what's ihat? 

Melanie: Well - in my hist assignment, [ added a few pictures 
and the feedback I got was lhai this wasni 'academic' 
enough,. So what might really bring it io life would lie to 
indude some dal a - provided we can find some. 

Alan: Yes - that sounds excellent. Well - we certainly have- a 
lot to do and not much time to do ii in. 

Melanie: You're right. I think we have about five weeks ho 
I suggest we create a plan of work today. The end of the

our work for us a lew days before l he deadline so we can 
make some llnaI changes. What about your friend Henry?

Listening Section 4 


Good morning and welcome to lists lean re on hair which 
is a part of the human biology course. This lecture covers a 
number of facts about hair - its si ry cm re and wbat can affect 
the general health ol hair. 

So. first of all. what is hair and why do we have It? tf we kink 
kick at our ancestors, we'll see that iltey had a lot more hair 
on their bodies than we do now. And there are - or were - two 


main reasons lor having hair One is to provide warmth ... hni 
as humans have -word chillies for many years, hotly hair lias 
significa Lilly reduced. The other is for proieiiion - and again 
this isn T as significant as it was once, hut hair does still benefit 
areas of the body such as the head and around the eyes. 

Now hair whatever il h lor and wherever it is on the human 
body is composed mainly oE a protein cal ini keratin. This, by 
the way, is also found in fingernails, In fact, ii's keralin which 
makes lhctn flexible and without it they would be very rigid. 
Another interesting fact about hair is that it is very 5 strong - as 
strong as Iron in fact. One single strand cati suppon a weight 
oE up io 100 grams. This may not sound all ibai much, bin 
a full bead uf hair can support up to 12 tonnes, which is thi- 
equivaleni of a couple oE dcp hams . which is simply amazing - 
though I advise you run in pm tins to the test! 

Hitmans lose up to 100 strands of hair a day, bin we do have 
quite a lot Of hair 10 Htarl with. There’s some variation depending 
on hair colour blit for an average adult the strand count is 
iOO.OUQ, so losing 100 a day is nut too bad. Although this is die 
average, people with red hair have around 80,000 strands, black 
or brown hair 100,000 and blondes have about 120,000. 

So hair used io be important for the reasons 1 mentioned 
earlier but nowadays Td say die main importance of liciir is 
ihe fact that it is big business. Apart Imm the money Involved 
in hai ran ling, shaving, dimming, eic., a fortune is spent just 
on hair produces . In the UK alone., consumers spend over five 
billion pounds each year on these. 
fpauwj 

So next. I'd like to jusl give you a quick overview of the 
strudure of hair. As you can see, along ihe length of ihe hair, 
there are three main parts called die bulb, ihe root and the 
shah. A single hair is fixed at one end below the skin in the 
bulb. The bulb acts rather like a cap - it encloses the end o! 
ihe hair in the head. The next |tan of the hair is the root and 
lhis is the part of the hair which lies just beneath the skin 
and, in terms of hair production, is die most important. This 
can he considered die Control centre for each strand nl tiair 
and is where the glands are found. These produce which 
flows along the length of ihe hair and die health ol the mot 
determines the overall health oE the strand of hair. The last part 
in [fie shaft and this is the hair which is above the skin and is, 
ol course, what we can see. Fortunately, diis is not active and t 
say 'fortunately' because otherwise it would be very painful to 
Iiave your hair cm! 

And finally fd jusl like to go over a few factors that impact on 
the overall health of Eiair. like every other pari of die body, 
our die! - ilia I is whai we eaf - is extremely important to the 
condition cil utar hair. Bui whereas a change in your diet to, 
lor example, eating unhealthy IobkIs will soon be noticeable in 
your skin, changes to your hair will lake a loi longer. A change 
in diei today could lake several ntombs m have an effect on 
your hair. And so - wliat is ihe key io heaIII>y hair? Well - 
eaiing a balanced diet is die in»si im|Hiriant thing. There are 
a number {>1 vitamin* lhai are vhal for good hair health, the 
main ones being vitamins c. I) and E, and in a balanced diet 
all these viiainins should be readily available, il you need a

Well, good morning everyone. As you know, mVe been 
looking at diEfcrcni kinds of an and crab thai were practised 
by the Maori people of New Zealand - at least before the 
Europeans heg-ns 10 arrive in ibo ESlIi century. So, ihe locus 
of lliis lecture is kite making: how the kites were made, their 
appearance and the purposes they served. 

Welt, lei S start with ihe way they were made. As with other 
Maori artistic traditions, kite-making involved certain rtntals. 
So, firstly, only priests were allowed to Ely and handle ihe 
largest, most sacred kites. There were rules, too, for the size 
and scale of the kites thai the priests had to follow, and during 
the prepwiiun o| buikam^JPdJ^gc kites, food strictly 

toffaiddi'rr 

En terms ol ap|H.aranee, kiles were frequently designed in llie 
image uF a native bird, or a Maori god, and sometimes, peiha|is 
less often, a well-known hero . You can imagine that when 
Maori lirsi arrived in ihe new country. In New Zealand, it may 
have taken some time En find suitable materials Eoi their kites 
- but through trial and error no doubt, [hey iound plants □sitJ 
trees that provided Kirk and even routs lhai they could use in 
make the frames and wings ol iheir kites. And aEler lire frame 
had been consmiaed, ihe kite ihen had lobe decorated. For 
this the priests used long grasses, and these-when the kite 
was in ihe air - would stream along behind it. They also used 
j- Y tirii't y nt tc atf i ers i n a dd, urn, col ou r i h e i r cmEiinfr- Well. 

all this meant it was easy in set a kite in the sky hut you could 
also /wwr Maori kites They could he quite noisy indeed, and 
this was because some priests liked to hang a long rmv of shells 
from the kite. You can imagine how they'd rattle and clatter in 
tho wind - flow they might completely cap!tire your aucniinn. 
As 1 said before, the most common image was probably a bird, 
and that’s the same for other kite-making cultures, but the kiles 
were designed in yttrticular shapes-so there were kites ihat 
were triangular, rectangular and a lso s hape d like a d iamo ud - 
And son? of them were so large, it would actually require 
several men io operate them, Unt, some nl the kites were also 
covered in patterns, and in make these psiierm. die Maori used 
different pigments of red and black, and these were either made 
front a charcoal i>ase or from red-brenvn day which bad been 
cot nbined with oil obtained from j loc al sfied« of shark. 

Now, before I forgei. ii you have a chance, do visit ihe 
Auckland Museum because they have the Iasi surviving 
'bird in an' kite on display. Tliis i% the kind of kite that has a 
wooden mask at ihe lop of the frame - it's a mask of n human 
head - ami you can clearly see it has a tattoo and also a set

Luca Rossi started a furniture company here in. Australia

had been a craftsman. He'd made furniture m Italy and 

he^assed this skill on to Luca's father, and weLLJjica 

1 bought he'd like to continue the t radii ion . 

Tutor: Ycx r that was the motivation behind his decision. And 
wltai was it. do you chink, that gave Furniture Eflssr a 
competitive edge over other furniture companies? 

James: E wouldn't think it was price. ITs always been at the 
higher end of the market, bul according to my research, il 
was to do with the attitude ol the employees - they were 
really focused on giving good customer service, 

Tutor: Yes. Luca Rossi insisted on that. Their promo norm I 
campaigns also emphasised the fact chat the wood only 
came front Australian forests, but that was the case with

Remember- the las* time you gave a presen cat ion on

Tutor: OK, so let s jusi think about lltc content of your 
ease study - the history of Furniture Rmsi. I see lie re in 
paragraph four you're talking aboul how Luca Rossi raised 
1 1 pc capital for his new business venture - and then you're 
talking about the customer base growing much wider - hut 
what was it that prompted iliis growth? 

James: Will, lhal was to kin with the qtuUily ul ilu- furniture 
products ihot rJie otunittny vwrs sdllng. People loved lhai 
it was all hand-made and would Iasi. 

TUlor: And because demand from customers kept growing? 

James: Well, then Rossi needed to take oil more craftsmen so 
I hey could make sure the orders were ready on Mine, and 
then, he also had to set up iivo new warehouses to make 
distribution quicken 

Tutor: Yes. And ho in there, the comply really grew. Bui 
think what happened next. They started looking at ways 
to increase their profits and called in a consultant And 
whai lie saw mi mediately was that the infrastructure was 
completely outdated - they were paying three full-time 
admin stall just lor data-entry' So he recommended they 
upaM de their software programs and that, in turn, cut 
operational costs and just speeded every tiling Lap. 

James: I m surprised they didn't gel on to that earlier, but 
I supi>ose Luca Rossi was more interested in the design 
aspect, rather than the finance side of things. 

Tutor: Yes, I imagine that's why he eventually turned the day- 
to-day running dj the company over to his son. And in fact, 
it was the son. Marco, who persuaded liis father to move on 
from traditional television advertising and go online instead. 

James; l guess ibat'^ the best w®y to- reach people. 

Tutor: it can be, hut initially, customers actually complained. 

Janies: Why?

around the website - sn they were getting fnis-Erau'd a nd

Listening Section 4 

Hello everyone and welcome. As part of this scries of lectures 
on the development of early humans, today we are looking at 
reck art: the paintings and drawings produced by prehistoric 
peoples as they spread across the continents, If you've been 
lucky enough to look at a piece of rock art close up, you'll 
know it sail experience that makes you wonder about the 
passage oi lime ami our own history. But rock art also has a 
practical value for researchers and lei's start by considering 
why that is. Firstly it provides vital Information about the way 
that people evolved - information not always easily obtainable 
Enuti excavated artefacts alone. Secondly, ruck art iclls us 
about mi gration : where people came from and where, perhaps, 
they went next. Rock art is found all over the world and thK 
in iiSL-ti is not surprising. Rut what is rather amazing, you 
might think, is Imw similar some images are, whether you're 
looking at a rock face isi South Africa or standing inside a cave 
in Spain. Let me give you an example. When our ancestors 
drew humans, they would often draw them as slick figures, 
but if they drew a face, then the eyes were almost always 
very prominent - very open and wide. And of course, animals 
are very common in rt^ck art r but one animal which is very 
interesting in researchers is the lizard, because whenever you 
sec a prehistoric palming of one - it's depicted either in profile 
nr looking down on h from above. And these drawings are 
produced by people of totally different cultural backgrounds. 
Amazing* Rut how can tills be the case - lhai similar artistic 
styles exist in Midi distant locations? In the past archaeologists 
believed that trade must have brought people together, and 
that it gave them the opportunity to observe each other's 
culture. Including art styles, but this didn't prove to be the case. 

Recently researchers have come up with a new theory. They 
believe that the brains of our ancestors evolved to notice 
certain Images before rubers and 1 liis was important - actually 
essential because in an environment lull uE constant danger, 
it was necessary for suivival - So ihe need lo quickly recognise 
things that could be helpful or harmful could have bad a 
great influence on reck art and explain why some Images are 
more common across cultures than others. Later on r there 
would have been other reasons why communities produced 
an - certainly for spiritual and social pyroses and no doubt 
for political ones, too, ^ different tribes I miked lor aides and 
struggled against their enemies. 

Well, as I said before* you can find rs^k art all over the world, 
but I d like 10 focus now on the rock art of the .Aboriginal 
people til Australia. The images that survive in this pari of the 
world span at least 20,000 years. In fact, file Aborigines were 
still practising this art form in the late l&lh century, when the 
Europeans began to arrive, and certain images point to the 
Contact between them. For example, the Aborigines began to 
draw ships which fitey would have seen along the coast - 'n\

Well, good afternoon. Hit Constable? James McDonald, and! 
as you may know, I'm the Community police officer lor ill*.- 
local area. That means that -as pan (>E rity job - I try 10 get 
4 hi i in ihe community as much as possible - talk to the people 
that live lai this neighbourhood - people like yourselves - and 
make sure there's an effective level uf communication between 
the public and the police - hence the reason for this meeting. 
There have been several burglaries in ihe area in the Iasi Eetv 
weeks a till I’d tike to talk about ways you can keep your home 
and property sale. 

So, I’d suggest ihal a good way lu Marl is by talking to your 
neighbours and exchanging coma a .deta ils with them. This II 
allow you to gei in touch immediately IE ihere's anything 
suspicious happening next door Then, make sure you have a 
good discussion about cht- best course oi action to lake in case 
oE emergen cy - make sure everyone Is clear about what to do 
and who to call. IE you plan ahead, this'll prevent uncertainty 
and even panic should anything happen later. Another thing 
lhai I would advise you to do is always leave your radio 
playing - even when you go out. And i! you keep your curtains 
dosed, burglars are less likely to try and break in because they 
can't be sure whether someone's home or not. Now. clone of 
us want to he in the situation where we can't get into our own 
home- but do take time in think where ihe l>csi and salest place 
is U* leave your spar e keys . Putting them under I he dour mat or 
anywhere near the front door is just asking lor trouble. You'd 
be surprised how many people actually do this- and it makes 
life really easy for burglars. All these things wilt help keep your 
community sale and will cost you nuihfng. However LI you are 
going to s|H?nd some money, whai I'd recommend more than 
anything else is ihat you invest in some well-made miisEsAY 
locks for your bouse. This will give you peace of mind.

OK, moving on. Unfortunately, there's been an increase in 
che number of minor crimes and antisocial behaviour in the 
general area and L warn to talk about some s|VecSfic prevention 
measures that are being proposed. FLrsi of ail the skate |urk. 
As you probably know, its well used by younger people in 
our community but nil fortunately we're getting more and 
more reports ol broken glass - making n especially dangerous 
for younger children. One possible solution here is Lo get rid 
of MlgoE the trees and hushes around the park - making 
it more visible to passershy and vehicles. If the vandaK 
know they're being watched, this might act as a deterrent. 

As you will have heard, a couple of local primary schools 
have also been vandalised recently - despite the presence uf 
security guards. The schools don't have the funds for video 
surveillance ~ so we need people in the neighbourhood to cad 
their neare^i police si at ion and Kiwi any su^uicioufr aclivi Ly 

immediately . Please don't hesitate to do this. I expect most of 
you are familiar with the problems facing Abbotsford Street. 

It seems chat no amount of warning ugns or S|>ecd cameras 
will slow speeding drivers down, I'm happy Eu say. however, 
that the council have agreed to begin work over the next 


few months us put lu a new ro.iuidaho .ui. What else? Oh, yes. 
The newsagent and the gill shop on Victoria Street were both 
broken into I a sc week, and although no motley was taken, 
the properties have suffered some serious damage. Access was 
gained to these shops Through the small alleyway at the hack 
ol the properties - it's dark and ^ you can imagine, no one 
saw the thief or thieves in action. So, we've been advising 
shop owners along there about what kind oi vi deo recordhip 
eq u i pment th e y can have put in - well Then Ik- able to gel

advised them to get graffiti cleat ted off tail mediate ly and net

presen tat Lon out. 

Karina; Well, we've done enough background reading. Inn t 
think we need to organise exactly uriur we're going to say 
about biofuels during the presentation, and the order, 
Mike: L thought we could start by asking our audience whai 
car engines were 15 rM designed to run on - lossil Ends or 
biofuels. 

Karina: Nice idea, 

Mike: Yes, when inosl people think about cars and luel, they 
think about all the carbon dioxide that's produced, but 
they don't realise that lhai wasn't always the case. 

Karina: You're probably right. The e arliest car engines ran on 
fuel made fr om com and peanut oiL d ida u to? 

Mike: Yes. The manufacturers used the corn and peanut oil and 
Hinted them into a kind ol very pure alcohol- 
Karina: You mean ethanol? 

Mike: Yes. Jn fact, most biofuels are still based on ethanol. 
Actually, I've got some notes here about ihe process ol 
turning plant-matter ijiki el ha no I - the chemical reactions 
and ihe fermcmaitun stages and .., 

Karina: It's interest big - the Other students would appreciate 
it, but different biofuels use different processes and i! we 
give a general description, risk w el l gel it 

and then the tutor might mark us down. I'd rather we 
focus on the environmental issues. 

Mike: Fair enough, So F utn - the main plants that are used for 
bio Enel production now are sugar cane, corn ... 

Karina: And canola. Of all of them, canola is probably the 
leasl harmful because machines Lii.it use it don't produce 
as much carbon monoxide. 

Mike: Sugar cane seems to he controversial. It doesn't 

require as much fertilizer as com does to grow, but when 
they burn the sugarcane fields* that releases loads of

turned out to be really profitable.

are concerned - they've got in the point where they don't

Good morning. Today we're thinking about the way that 
technology is Inlluenclng our social Structures arid tfie way we 
imeraci with one another. Humans, as we know, have always 
lived in groups; without this arrangement, our species would 
have died out long ago. But now, the way we see and deline 
our grrntp is changing. 

I'd like to start, by mentioning the research nl American 
sociologist Mark Granovctler in i 97k ii was Cm no vet ter 
who firm coined the term 'weak-ties’, which he used to refer 
to people's loose acquaintances - in other words, Eriends-nl- 
lrlends. His research shouted that iveak-ties had a significant 
effect on the behaviour and choices of populations - and 
this in 11 uenee was something highly important in the fields 
of information science and politics, and as you can imagine, 
marketing also. So, these I ricmH-ni-friends, |*eople we might 
spend time with at social or work gatherings, might not tie like 
us but they can still have a positive [nilpence because we share 
tfie same sort of LmyCLsis, Thai’s enough tu make a connection 
-and this connection can lum nut to he mote beneficial than 
we ring 111 suspect. An example- oi ibis., an example of him 
tfie connection can influence ns. is when our weak-lies get 
in touch and pass on details about Juki they think might be 
suitable for tis. Well, since Granuveiter Jirst cause up with this 
l henry, his work lias been cited in over 19,000 papers. Some of 
these studies have looked at how weak-lie network? are useful 
to us in other ways, and one tiling that seems to improve as a 
result of weak -ctv influence is our ti^ollh- 
irnme} 

Today. mu mini her oi weak-lie acquaintances has exploded 
due us the lute met - lo ihe phenomenon nl online 
social networking. This is still a relatively new way of 
communication - something that has a huge amount of 
potential - but also, as with any Invention, it brings with ii 
a new set of problems. Let's start with the benefits. Without 
question, online social networking allows us up pass on the 
latest news - m he LiP4o:daie with local and global went? 
-and Eor many, this information comes Erotn sources more

discussed, 1 think, personally speaking, that wc need some 
further research before we can definitively say whether it 
Help* or run. There's alsti been a great increase in ihe number 
oF ci el working sites devoted to sharing advice on health issues 
tun (here lire as yet no studies to prove the reliability oE that 
advice. Now, what we tic have- clear evidence for is that people 
are developing friendships and professional nelworfcs in a 
way that wasn't possible More - the process is laster, I'm noi 
talking about quafliy here, but simply that they e\ist, And it’s 
debatable whether ihe number of online friends (hai you have 
increases your level of selE-confidence -that's perhaps an area 
of rescareti some of you might be interested in following up. 
Turning to the problems,, there are any number of ankles 
connecting online activity to Falling levels of physical fitness- 
but it’s loo easy to blame the Internet itir our social problems. 
The \muv grades ol vcluM children an: also Frequently linked 
Lo the time spent on social networking sites, hut it would be 
naive to believe there are tin other co.mi'ibtiiing factors, One real 
concern, however, is the Increase In the amount oE fraud. Where 
for example. people are u s ing ihe pe rson al d at a o;l o ilier^ which

online social net working niLes have provided a great time- 
wasting opportunity - reducing protjuctivUv 
and 1 Juubt they can pm a stop to this habit , no mat ter what 
restrictions are in place. 

Well conic back to these issues in a minute, hut [VI Like 
io say something about the theories of Rubin Dunbar - an 
anthropdogjst at Oxford University. Dunbar lias found that 
the human brain has evolved in a way that means we can 
only give re.il attention to a particular number of people, 1 50, 
apparently. Su, for example, il tlu- number of friends on your

Nick: ITs pretty cheap, you can get a bed in a dormitory for 
nineteen dollars per person Private rooms cost a bit more, 
bill well be OK in dormitories, won't we? 

Julie: Sure. 

Nick: So that hostel has parking, though that doesn't really 
matter to us as well be using public transport. 

Julie: Yeah. Are there any reviews on the website Iron! people 
who've been there? 

Nick: Well, yes. They aren't all ill a I good though. Some 
people said they didn't like ihe staff, they had an 
unfriendly attitude. 

Julie: Mmin, That's quite unusual in a hostel, usually ail the 
slafl are really welcoming. 

Nick:That'<. what I thought. People said they liked the padi 
and the Eaa that the rooms had air-conditioning, but the 
problem with that was that it was very noisy so they were 
kepi awake. But It was too hot if they turned it off. so they 
had to put up with it,

Julie: So there's always someone on reception. That sounds 

gikid. 

Nick: The only criticism I saw was that the rooms were a bit 
messy and untidy because people just left their clothes 
and stuff all over the beds and the floor, 

julie: Don't hostels usually have lockers in the bedrooms 
where you can leave your stuff? 

Nick: Yeah, they do usually, but apparently they don’t here. 
Still, hostels are never particularly tidy places, so that

Hello everyone and welcome to the Anglia Sculpture Park. 
Right, well the idea behind the sculpture park is that it's a 
place where works of an: such as large sculptures acid carvings 
can be displayed out of doors in a natural setting. 

As you'll have noticed when you drove here, mosi of the land 
around ihe park is farmland. The park it sell belonged to a 
family called the IV Quincies, who bail made a lot of money 
from manufacturing farm machinery, ami who also owned 
substantial si retches of forest laud tea the north of the s*ark- 
They built a house in the centre ol ihe park, not far front 

but ibis burnt down in 19&0 and 
the He Qmodes then sold the land. 

The Anglia Sculpture Park isn't the only one in the country; 
several of the London parks sometimes display contemporary 
sculptures, and there are a couple of other permanent 
sculpture parks in England. But m'n unique in I hat Min e o E 

irar sculptures were actually mated Uu the .sh« ihcy reaiFV 

here , ami we also show sculptures by a wider range pi artists 
than anywhere else in (he country. 

For example, at present we have an exhibition by Joe 
Tremain, ol what he calls 'burnt' sculptures. These are wood 
and stone sculptures that lie s carved and marked with fire 
w illustrate [hsiicrychy and. Mien shy of the In rccs that have 

shaped our planet over millions ol wars . They look really 
dramatic in this rural setting. 

To see some oE the sculptures, you'll need lo follow the path 
alongside the Lower Lake. Wg bad It? rciTOYaiV ilm Jlicr the 
Lake overlbuved its banks a couple ol mouths ago and flooded 
the ares. The water Level's back to normal now arid you 
shouldn't have any trouble, the path’s very level underfoot. 

You should be back at the Visitor Centre at about four o'clock 
H you have time it's worth taking a look at the Centre itself. 

It's not possible to go upstairs at p resen 1 as builders arc 


wo rking there adding another Hour , but the rest's well worth 
seeing. The architect was Guy King. He was actually born in 
this part ol England but he recently designed a museum in 
Canada that won a prize for innovation In public buildings. 

JJ you want lo get some thing to eat when you get back, lake a 
snack or a sandwich, i lie Terrace Room is currently closed, but 
yon can go to the kiosk and buy some 11 ling , then sit on one oi 
ilie chairs overlooking the Lower Lake and enjoy the view as 
you're eating. 

Ipaustj 

Now, let me just tell you a bit about what you can see in 
the Sculpture Park. J1 you look at your map, you'll see the 
Visitor Centre, where we are now, at llie bottom, just by the 
entrance. Since we only have an hour, you might not he able 
to gel riglu around the park, but you can choose to visit some 
ol the highlights. 

You might like to take a look at the JocJmnaiu HC UlflUlFO

An interesting aspect i*l fireworks i? that their history lells us 
a ku about the changing role? of scientists and technicians in 
Europe. Fireworks were introduced from China Lai the Utb 
century. Up to the 16th century they were generally used for 
military purposes, with rockets and lire tubes being thrown 
at the enemy, but they were also sometimes a feature of plays 
and festivals where their chief purpose wav related to religion . 

Ry ihe 17th century, the rulers of Euru|K- had started using 
fireworks as a way of marking royal occasions. Technicians 
were employed to stage spectacular shows which displayed 
aspects of nature, wilh representations of the sum snow and 
rain. These shows were designed For the enjoyment of the 
nobility and m impress ordinary people. Bui fireworks also 
aroused the interest of scientists, who started to think of 
new uses tor them. After seeing one firework display where 
a model of a dragon was propelled along a rope by rockets, 
scientists thought that in a similar way, humans might be 
able to achieve Hi gin - a dream of many scientists at tEie time. 
Other scientists, such as the chemist Robert Boyle, noticed 
how in displays one I ire work might actually light a tun her. and 
it occurred to him that fireworks might provide an effective 
way iiF demonstrating bow stars were formed.

Sciertifci? at the [line often depended mi the royal courts 
for patronage, but there was cotisklerabk variation in the 
relationships between the courts and Helenlists in different 
countries. This was reflected in altitudes towards fireworks 
and the [purposes Eor which they were used, hi London In 
ihe middle of the l Tali century there was general distrust of 
fireworks among scientists. However, taler in I lie century 
scientists and technicians started io look ai the practical 
purposes for which fireworks might be employed, such as 
using rockets io help sailors establish their ptJisition ai sea. 

It was a different story in Russia, where the St Petersburg 
Academy of Science played a key role in creating fireworks 
displays fur the court. Here, those in power regarded (ireworks 
as being an important element in the education of the masses, 
and the displays often included a sclents lie message. Members 
iiE the Academy hoped that this might encourage the Royal 
Family to keep ihc Academy open at a time when many In ihe 
govern me11t were consider! ng clos i ng i i. 

hi Paris, the situation was dJIlerem again. The Paris Academy 
uf Sciences played no role in staging firework? displays. 

Instead clie task fell tin members ol the Royal Academy 
of Painting and Sad pi u re. As in Russia, ihe wiirk of the 
tccbriidans who treated the lire works was given little 
at tent inn. Instead, the fireworks and the spectacle they 
created were all designed in encourage the public to believe 
in tlie supreme authority of the kiny . However, science was 
a I ho enmnwuHly popular among the French nobility, and 
fashionable society flocked to demonstrations such as Nicolas 
Lemery's display representing art erupting volcano. The 
purpose of scicmists was basically to offer entertainment to 
fashionable society, and academicians delighted In amazing 
audiences with demonst rat Lons oE the universal taws of nature. 

{pause} 

In the course of the I 8 ih century, (tic circulation of skills and 
technical exchange led to further developments. Fireworks 
specialists from Italy began to travel around Europe staging 
displays for many ot ihe European courts. The architect and 
stagi- designer Giovanni Servo ndoni con tossed gram! displays 
in Parts, featuring colour!oily painted temples and triumphal 
arches. A fireworks display staged by Servandoni would be 
structured in ihe same way as an opera , and was even divided 
into separate acts, [talian Eireworks specialists were also invited 
to perform in London, Si Petersburg and Moscow, 

As these specialists circulated around Europe, they sought in 
exploit the appeal of Eireworks for a wider audience, including 
the growing middle classes. As io the previous century, 
fireworks provided resources lor demonstrating scientific 
l.m-s and theories, an well as new discoveries, ami displays 
now showed a fascinated public the curious phenomenon of 
electricity . By the mid - L$rii century, fireworks were being sold 
Eor private consumption. 

So the history ol firework? shows us the diverse relationships 
which existed between scientists, technicians and the rest of 
society ,,,

Stewart: Yes. I think they were quite surprised; at how well l 
managed that. It was just eIu- Luck of the draw actually, I'd 
dime ihai projea with you Iasi year ...

Stewart: The casting? Yeah. I'd expected ihai the people who

Stewart: How my project benefited the Association, you 
mean? So do I have in include that? 

Tutor: Yes, 

Stewart: Well, let's think ... 1 suppose if t hadn't made the film 
for them. They'd have had to get an outside onmivmy to do 
il. Bui because I was actually working for the Association, 

Things like their responsibility fur ihe conservation of ihe

ihai understanding, they'd have been more detached. 
Tutor: Right, And ihe Association also said tEiat because of 
your background, you had a good idea l>E where logo to

ihe saving in expense made ii worthwhile even chough

I ni going to lalk today aboui research imoa parricukr species 
ol bird, iEie New Caledonian crow, whose natural hahiiai is 
filial I islands in tEie Pacific Ocean. And il seems ihai these 
crows are exceptionally resourceful. 

Using slicks or Either unite to find food isn't unknown among 
birds and animals. Some chimpanzees, for example, are known 
lo bang nuts on stones, in order 10 break che slid I and gel ai 
ilie edible kernel Inside. One New Caledonian crow, called 
Belly, bem some straight wir e into a h<?p_b and used it to lift 
a small bucket of her favourite food from a vented pipe. This 
experiment was the First rime she'd been presented with wire, 
which makes il very impressive. Another crow, called Barney 
has demonstrated liis skill at using sticks io forage for food. 

In one research project, scientists from New Zealand and 
Os lord sei captive New Caledonian crows a three-stage 
problem: if they wanted to extract food from a hole, (he crows 
first had is jaifl un. awning [p. m a slum biick r then use iliat 
short stick to remove a Jong stick from a toolbox, and finally 
use the long stick in reach the food. Amazingly, (hey worked 
out llow to do this successfully. 

Fun her experiments carried out at Oxford suggest that crows 
can also use Slicks as tools to inspect all sorts of objects, 
possibly to assess whet her or mu they present a danger. Tin?

Recording scripts • 


idea for the experiment came Irqm itb^eriilg llie birds using 
tools to pick at random objects, such as a picture of a spider 
that was primed on some doth. In this research, Bvc pairs 
oi crows - including Barney - underwent tests to see how 
they would react to a variety of objects, which were carefully 
chosen so the birds wouldn't be tempted to view them as a 
possible source of food, Asa further precaution, all tin- crows 
had been fed IwforehaiuL 

On eight occasions, a bird's first contact was by using a tool, 
hi all three I rials, Barney began by using a slick for Inspection. 
OlK inv oiced a rubber snake , First he approached El, but didn't 
touch it, ihen retreated to pick up a slick. He then prodded it 
with the stick. After some more investigation, he discarded die 
slick and carried on pecking at the snake more Confidently - 
apparently convinced that it wouldn't move, 
in other cxpermierils. two different birds, called Pierre and 
Corheau r also made a lirst approach wilh tools on three 
nrparaie occasions. Pierre used a short piea 1 of woodchip 
to touch a lielu which was flashing. *nnd Corbeau was seen 
prodding a metal toad with ji slick. 

SigniEicamiy. Ibe crows I ended to use the slicks only to make 
their firsi Contact with the object Subsequently, they eilher 
ignored the object or dropped the tool and [vecked at the 
object - which is very different from using the tool to get 
access 10 food. 

(paustl 

So what conclusions can be drawn from the research? 

Evidence is building up from experiment* such as these tbai 
ihe birds arc able to plan their actions in advance, which is 
very interesting lor understanding their cognition. They don't 
seem to be responding in a pre-programmed son of way: it 
may even be possible that they’re able to view a problem and 
work out what Lise answer is. However, a major difficulty 
is a ssessing wheth er this mol-usi ng behaviou r is a sljj n ol 

intelligence - To some extern, litis is related to the ecological 
circumstances in which the animal is found. 

So scientists want to Itud out much more about how the crows 
behave in ihelr native habitat, and a team from Exeter and 
Ox lord universities Is carrying out research in Mew Caledonia. 
They're looking into whether the birds’ way of searching for 
food gives them any |ii.^sible evolutionary advantage. The birds 
Lire hard to observe, as ihey live in l 1 region u[ mountainous 
forest, so the researchers have ana dled liny cameras to ihe tails 
o l so me bJidir as one method of investigating their behaviour 
The birds are masters at using sticks to find ihelr fund, in 
particular beetle larvae Irom the trees. Its possible ihat the 
birds can derive so much ener g y horn these grubs that they 
only need to eai a Jew each day, This would mean thai they 
wouldn't have lo spend most of their waking time searching 
for food, as most animals do. 

The beetle larvae have a dbimeultemlCsi] nuke-up . which 
can tie traced through the feathers and blood of birds that eal 
ihem. Scientists have collected samples from crows in order 
lo estimate the proportion of larvae m.ilieir diet . They should 
then be able to gauge the extent to which Individual birds 
depend on using sticks to feed themselves. 


We've learnt a great deal about ihe ability oJ New Caledonian 
crows io use tools, and some very Interesting research is being 
carried out into them.

Overall a greater pcrceniage ol British people gave money to

Sample answer 

Over [he |>asi 50 years, people have become used to the idea 
that ihey will probably live longer lhan their grandparents 
did. However a lunger life is* only desirable il you can look 
a her yourself and be independent, otherwise there can he 
disadvantages for everyone. 

II you walk into a hospital in my country, you arc likely to see 
a list more elderly people than you did in the past. In fact, this 
is causing significant problems ^ (here is a shortage of beds. 
Medical treatment is keeping the elderly alive, hui at vvliat cost 
to others? 

On iop oE this, one of the bigger medical problems these days 
is dementia, Even ii old people are still fit, they may not be 
able to look after ihemsclves. They may have to live with their 
children or be cared for In a home, which can be expensive, 
Elderly people do nol like io he a burden, but their children 
cart lee I obliged to care for them, 

Obviously not all old people become Si U Those who remain 
healthy can enjoy a happy old age as long as they have saved 
enough money. People are much more active in their si Mies 
and seventies ihan they used lo he and ihis can only be a good 
ihing. They have time to enjoy their retirement and do a range 
of activities that they could noi du when they were at work. 
They can also help look after iheir grandchildren, which is a 
great benefit tor working parents. 

To sum up, I believe that we should aim to keep people 
as healthy as possible vu shat they can enjoy their old age 
without having to rely on others. A longer life expectancy is 
obviously advantageous,, bin m* one wants to live so be 100 if 
they only cause problems for iheir family and society.

The diagrams show West Park School at three different stages 
in its development: 1950, 1980 and 2010. 
tn 1950, [lie school was buili close to a main road and next io a 
number of limiscv A large area behind ihe school was turned into 
a playground, while the area behind the houses was farmland. 

By 1980. the houses had been demolished in order to make 

way In r a snitill car park and ail additional school build tug. 

which became the science block. In addliion to the existing 
playground, the school also gained ihe farmland and 
converted ii into a sports field. 

In 2010. the school building remained unchanged but the car 
park was extended to cover the entire spurts field- As a result 
of this, the original playground was divided into two so thai it 
provided ,1 smaller playground and a small sports field. 

During this period, ihe school has increased in size and a car park 
has been created and enlarged. The combined recreational areas, 
however, firsi expanded and were then reduced In *ize.

Writing Task 2 

Sample answer 

Mo m people would ajirct- chat ear ownership has increased in 
ream years and is causing a range nl problems, particularly 
in built-up areas. I think there are a number of ways that 
govern menu can a ini to deal with this. 

Many big lilies in the world have traffic problems hut these 
problems vary. For example, h is reasonably easy IP drive 
around my chy after 10 am and before 5 pm. However, outside 
these hours, you have lu allow double the usual lime to reach 
your destination. In some other cities, traffic is congested at all 
limes, and there is the omiEnual sound of car boms as people 
iry to gel wherever they want to go. 

One of the best approaches governments can take in busy 
cities is lo encourage the use of public transport. This means 
Elie transport facilities have to he well run and people must be 
able m afford them. Buses, trams and lrains are good ways oE 
gelling around., and it lhey are cheap and reliable, people will 
use them. 

Another approach is to discern rage people from actually 
entering the city by building car parks ami shopping centres 
on tile t]Li [skirls. Matty cities a e OIL nil the world do ibis quite 
successfully and idler passengers Inis transport huo ihc centre, 
iif they need it. 

At peak travel periods, governments can also run campaigns 
to encourage people co he less dependent on their cars. 
Apparently, a lot of car trip?, involve very shon journeys u>. say. 
1 he Supermarket or local school. These are often unnecessary, 
bill we automatically gel in our tars without l Elin king. 

Clearly we all have a responsibility in look after our cities. 
Government can do a lol to improve the situation and pari 
l 1 1 what they do should involve encouraging individuals to 
consider alternatives lo driving.

Writing Task 1 

Sample answer 

Tim bar chan illustrates the pe Hof omnia- of Somhland's 
primary exports in 2000 and 2013. It also indicates future 
projections for 2025. According to the data, u seems likely 
chat international tourism will become the dominant industry, 
although dairy exports will remain strong, in 20U0. we can 
see iliai tourism was ihe greatest exports earner of the three 
industries, with revenue standing at just over £8 billion. 

This figure has increased slightly, so lhai now, in 201 V it has 
reached almost £9 billion, ti is titrated that international 
tourism will continue to grow, so ihai by 2025. it will be- 
earning around LI0 billion lor the country. In 2000. dairy 
exports were worth around £7 billion, bul sjnci- then there 
has been a dramatic increase, and sales for ibis year are 
approximately £10 billion. Experts are predicting that exports 
in ihis area may fall slightly, so a ligure of £9.5 billion is 
expected for 2025. Meat produce are the third key industry in 
Southland, but sales have dropped since 2G0Qand now stand 
at LI*. 5 hi I lion. It is expected dial sales will continue io decrease 
in ihe future.

Sample answer 

The growth of the Li^i food industry hav without doubt. 
Impacted ml the earing habits and the health til many sodelies 
■around Nil- world. Ui alwto. Jiitih fhotcMvrol. lican auJ 
respiratory problems are all on the rise due to tatty ami suga r- 

ridi food *. However, the question is whether higher tax would 
Improve this situation or iioe. 

From an economic point oE view, higher might seem 
sensible, In cmimries such as the USA, Australia and Britain *, 
the healthcare system spends a large part of its budget on 
people witEi diet-related health problems, li could be argued 
that these people have l □ ievl'l 3 their own Ml nesses because uf 
their choice of food- In this case, why should sliey expect the 
xtate to pay for their treatment? Tlx 1 tax: could help fund the 
healthcare system. 

However, we also need to consider which socio-economic 
group consumes fast food as the main part ol their diet. 

Statistics indicate* that lower Income groups cat more of 
I his food than wealthier people, -tine possible reason for ihis 
is ihai East food is far cheaper than Iresh produce. This is 
because many governments offer large subsidies so farmers 
who provide products Eor she hist fond Industry such as corn, 
wheat and beef. Fruit and vegetables, on the other hand, are 
nut subsidised. Research suggests - that many families simply 
cannot afford to buy healthy food or pay higher taxes oil fast 
loud. For them, fasi few id is not a choice but a necessity. 

tn conclusion, imposing a higher ux on fasi I nod does not seem 
to be the answer, II the government chose to do this, it would 
only lead [o greater poverty and laniilies bong further hardship,

The iwo pie chans compare the percentages of online vales 
across different retail sectors in New Zealand In the years 2U03 
and 2013. For three ol the sectors, h is evident that over this 
lime frame there wax significant change iri their proportion of 
online transactions, 

At 36% we can see tliai the iravel sector accounted for the 
majority of online sales in 2003, but this percentage had 
dropped to 29% by 2013. Across the same ten-year period, as 
an increasing number of people chose to purchase films and 
music online. we can see lhal transactions went from just 23 % 
to 3 3%. making it llie retail sector with the highest overall 
share of the online market. 

En 2003. the clothing industry boasted an impressive 24% nl 
total online sales in New Zealand. However, by 201 3, the figure 
had fallen considerably lo 16%. Interestingly, online sales of 
fajokx eventually overtook sales ol dothes, although books still

Writing Task 2 

Sample answer 

In recent years., advances in technology have allowed 
govern mehts, the police ami privately owned companies 
to keep the public under constant surveillance. hi many 
major dries and towns, security cameras are recording the 
move meins of ordinary tiiL/env. Whenever a cellphone is 
used, the call is logged ho the service provider knows exactly 
when and where die user made the call. Invisible said I lies 
orbit die Earth, watching ns whether we like it or nol. Is this, 
however a development we should welcome? 

Certainly die re are benefits, Iei areas where there is a high 
crime race, the use oi security cameras may act as a deterrent 
to criminals: if they can see a camera, they may think twice 
about breaking into a building or stealing a car. If a crime is 
carried out, then a camera may provide useful evidence. The 
same is true for a cellphone; the police sometimes rely on call 
logs its help them trace die whereabouts of suspect* or victims. 

Oo the other hand, there are a number of concerns. Ill 
countries where human rights are ignored, the use of security 
cameras os listening devices may Lie harnvlitl 10 society. People 
should be able to hold meetings and express their opinions 
without their privacy being invaded. There is also a very 
different issue we should consider. Nowadays, many people 
upload personal i til or mat ion and photographs onto social 
networking sites; they often do not realise how easy it is lor 
other people to view this information or (or die site owners to 
use the data or photographs for their own financial gain. 

It seems inevitable dial there will he mure and more ways lo 
monitor society In die future. However it is our responsibility 
to evaluate new technology and deride whether U will do 
more harm than good. Surely pur freedom is more valuable 
ilian technological progress?

Sample answer 

The pursuit n( knowledge is a concept that is valued by must 
cultures. In the 2 hi century, we now have many more 
options regarding how and where lo find that knowledge, [f 
you are a French national, you can apply to do an economies 
degree in the USA, and likewise an American citizen can take 
a course in linguistics in France. Indeed, most universities 
across the world notv have a good proportion of foreign 
students enrolled in liielr programmes. 

Certainly, there arc numerous advantages of studying in a 
different country. Many students choose to do i his. because 
they know that a particular university, for instance Start ford 
It use i less School, has an excellent reputation. Graduating from 
here, they believe, will increase their chances of securing a 
decent position itt a company back home, Students studying 
abroad also have die opportunity to Form friendships with 
people of various nationalities: in time, these may develop into 
useful professional networks. Furthermore, living Ear bom 
la mi I y and friends can enable young people to become more 
independent am! sell-sub idem. 

Unfortunately, the experience oE studying abroad Is not always 
a positive one. Research suggests that a small percentage nf 
young people struggle to adapt to their new environment 
and sober from severe culture shock- The situation can 
become worse it the student ls not mature enough to Cope 
by themselves. DilEeivm approaches to teaching and learning 
may also come as an imwelcome surprise to some students. 

hi essence, the key to a good experience at a foreign 
university is an open mind. II a student is presented with ibis 
opportunity, they should certainly sci/e it.

Sample answer 

Nowadays we are living in a society based cm consuming. As a 
result, some people have problems in dealing with Eliis budget 
and they get Lnui debt by buying things they dnn'i need and 
can'E afford. 

Tiles Lind of behavior is encountered quSie often in our present 
days, mainly because of the possibility of buying goods in

Also, another cause for this behavior could (h 1 psychological, 
Tlu fc advcrtlsmcni and the subliminal message one encounters 
in a regular day in a big city has an enormous impact on 
one's brain. The main problem is ihe lack of awareness of the 
serious effects ibai adveriismeni can have on people. 

lit order to prevent people Irani adopting this dangerous 
behavior, measures should be taken so as 10 raise awareness 
among people. Also, tine must learn lu>w to manage his
